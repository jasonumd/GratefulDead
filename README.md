# **GratefulDead**
Digitizing Grateful Dead data and making it freely available to all Deadheads.

## **Deadbase XI**
Updated OCR was generated on the Deadbase XI scan using NAPS2. New PDF was exported as .txt using Adobe Reader. SHA-512 hashes of these files are included.  

## **music_album_rename**
This script uses a database from JerryBase.com to set the album and artist/albumartist of an entire Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia library based on the date in the show folder name.  The folder must start with either "gd" or "jg" and the date must be in YYYY-MM-DD format. The album format is "YYYY-MM-DD (sbd/aud/fm/tv/fob/studio/gmb/pa/mtx [Miller] [shnid]) [(Early/Late Show)] Venue, City, State". The database is courtesy of the database admin for JerryBase.com and it contains all information for Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia shows. Obtaining an export of this database was a lifesaver, especially for tagging Jerry Garcia shows.
