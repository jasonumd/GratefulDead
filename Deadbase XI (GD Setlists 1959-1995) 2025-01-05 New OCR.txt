Coffeehouse; located in the upstairs loft of the Carlos Bookstall * (1) 
Robert Hunter, acapella. This set and the 01/??/62 Burlingame set also 
circulate together as "Garcia, Hunter and Albin '62." It can be argued 
that the 'room ambience' and recording quality of both tapes are 
identical; they -sound-like they were recorded at the same time. 
Recordings:: 25 A?. Audience recording, made on reel-to-reel by 
Rodney Albin, possibly from mics placed on stage. Bolshevik In Hell

??/??/?? Unknown venue 
Set 1: Blues Jam [2:24]; Careless Love [0:41] > In The Pines [3:12]; 
Goin' To Chicago [2:38] 
Set 2: 99 Years [4:41#]; Blue Goose [2:35] 
Comments: other personnel unknown * "Unident Thing" * Other 
artists included: Mike Sector. My reasoning for listing this separate 
(from 06/11/62): I think the above is the same material you have listed 
(after Three Men Went A-Hunting) on 6/11/62. And indeed, this 
follows Three Men W.A.H. on one of my copies of 6/11/62... but it's 
listed separately as "Unident Thing w/ Pig & Jerry"... that's it --no 
date, location, venue. Specific reasons (in no particular order): 

* it's listed on my tape separately 
* there is a splice and a marked difference in sound quality 
and tone 
* Pigpen only appears on *this* portion / other personnel 
have changed 
* Sandy Troy's 'Early Garcia Song List' ("Captain Trips," 
Appendix A) seems to agree (that the 6/11/62 set ends 
with Three Men W.A.H.). 
My reasoning for listing two sets: 
After Goin' To Chicago, Mike Sector introduces himself (apparently as 
a guest act, between sets): "I don't think many of you know me, but I'm 
a guest here tonight. My name is Mike Sector and..."(cut) Then cuts 
into: crowd silence>applause> Garcia: "Uh, I'm back again, but this 
time it's purely secondary, uh... a lot of... perhaps those of you that 
heard, uh... Ron play the harmonica, were impressed by his playing... 
playing, but there is another side to this... even more impressive, I 
think.... So, even though he'd be the last to admit it... I'd better shut 
up." Note: And I'm not extremely convinced 'Blue Goose' belongs with 
this list. It, too, has a slightly different sound quality and tone. Does 
that sound like Garcia's guitar-playing to you

Comments: Jerry Garcia and David Nelson * "College of San Mateo

Garcia, acapella. Note: I'm not an extremely technical person 
(especially when it comes to reel-to-reels), but FWIW the 'reel 
problems' mentioned sounds like a tape slack/speed problem (if there is 
such a thing)... basically just a momentary increase in speed... all the 
music is still there (just extremely fast/compressed). 
Recordings:: 34 A?. Audience recording, possibly from mics placed 
on stage. Reel problems resulting in losses of 3-4 secs in Raging Sea

Comments: The Wildwood Boys: Jerry Garcia, banjo; Robert Hunter, 
guitar; David Nelson, mandolin; Norman Van Mastricht, bass. Note: I 
have three different copies of this. On the most complete copy, the 
'KFOG Deadhead Hour' intro is included... and it explains a good bit 
about how these tapes (2/23/63, 5/??/63 [Jerry & Sarah] and ??/??/63 
[Second Story Men]) came into circulation: [Before 5/??/63 Jerry & 
Sarah:] DJ: (cut) "...primo sounding. How did you get such good 
tape?" RR: "Well, these are courtesy of, uh, Dr. Stu Goldstein --a 
fellow physician in, uh, Walnut Creek --wco-manager of the Tangent 
back in, uh, 1963. Yeah." DJ: "Wow! That's really cool." RR: "So 
tonight we're gonna hear, uh, first Jerry and Sarah Garcia. Deep Elem 
Blues, uh, Will Of The Weaver, I Truly Understand, All The Good 
Times Are Past And Gone, Long Black Veil, Man Who Wrote 'The 
Home Sweet Home' Never Was A Married Man, Keno The Rent Man, 
and finally, If I Was On A Foggy... oh, Some Foggy Mountain Top. 
Here we go." DJ: "Alright, here we go, on the KFOG Deadhead Hour." 
[After 5/??/63, before 2/23/63:] DJ: "Wow! This is the KFOG 
Deadhead Hour. And Richard, that was incredible." RR: "Yeah... it's 
not the KFOG, uh, Hayseed Hour. I know it sounds that way, but this 
is, uh... some early stuff from 1963, from uh... the early portion of that 
year, from the Tangent, in Palo Alto. And that was, uh, Jerry and Sarah 
Garcia --right down to announcing their nuptials. That was... that was 

pretty interesting." DJ: "Yeah." RR: "Well, let's, uh, keep going here. 
This is the Wildwood Boys. And I do have a date --a precise date --on 
this one. How about that? Two, twenty-three, sixty-three (2/23/63). 
Again, at the Tangent, uh... and they are: Jerry Garcia, Robert Huntr, 
David Nelson and, uh, Norm Van Mastrict. And, uh, here's a bunch of 
stuff: Rollin' In My Sweet Baby's Arms, Jerry's Breakdown, Standin' In 
The Need Of Prayer, Muleskinner Blues, then a solo number by Norm, 
and, uh, Pike County Breakdown, Come All Ye Fair And Tender 
Maidens and We Shall Not Be Moved --right here on the KFOG 
Deadheads Hour." [After 2/23/63, before Second Story Men:] DJ: 
"You're listening to the KFOG Deadhead Hour. With us tonight, 
Richard Raphel(sp?) who is responsible for giving us all these, uh... 
these great tapes. Hi Richard." RR: "Well it's a pleasure to 'em all. 
Yeah." DJ: "Oh... boy. I'm really diggin' this stuff." RR: "Well, that 
was the, uh, Wildwood Boys: Jerry Garcia, Bob Hunter, uh, Dave 
Nelson and, uh, Norm Van Mastrict. And we're gonna continue now 
with, uh, just a couple of tunes from the Second Story Men which was, 
uh, Pigpen's group around the same time. This is also recorded at the 
Tangent... in Palo Alto. And we just have time for two quick ones... uh, 
McKernan's Blues and the Rocky Mountain Blues --here on the KFOG 
Deadhead Hour."

Comments: Black Mountain Boys: Jerry Garcia, banjo and guitar; 
David Nelson, mandolin; Sandy Rothman, guitar, Robert Hunter, bass 
player. My reasoning for listing Sandy Rothman as guitarist and Robert 
Hunter as bassist: * Before Homestead On The Farm, someone (Robert 
Hunter?) says: "We're gonna do a song called Homestead on the Farm. 
Or, Sandy's gonna sing a song." * Before Two Little Boys, someone 
(Hunter?) says: "Uh, while Sandy tunes his guitar... The next song is 
gonna be Two Little Boys... or the name of the next song is gonna be 
Two Little Boys. The name of the next song *is* Two Little Boys, in 
fact." * Before Rosalie McFall, Garcia says: "Sandy gets to play... uh, 
play a lot of stuff on this one here." * Before Love Please Come 
HomeSo Sandy went and foolishly put new strings on his guitar last 
month . . . ." * Sandy Troy lists the following personnel ("Captain 
Trips," Appendix A): Garcia, banjo; David Nelson, mandolin; Robert 
Hunter, bass; Sandy Rothman, guitar. My reasoning for listing as Set 2: 
and Set 3: (and not Set 1:): * Before Sawood Mountain, Garcia 
mentions: "We figured we'd just stand around this set, you know. . . we 
played last set" (... so I'm assuming there was another set before this Set 
1:.) * My tape ends (cuts) during John Hardy with Garcia(?) 
saying: "Thank you very much for, uh... bearing with us, coming to see 
us, and... we'll be back in about 20 minut..."(cut) IMO, this is definitely 
a set break --but between which two sets? I'm missing the Roll On 
Buddy-->Black Mtn. Rag, so I can't tell where this might belong (but 

Sandy Troy lists it after Make Me A Pallet On Your Floor -and does 
not list the John Hardy at all). BTW, there is *not* a cut/splice 
between Make Me A Pallet and John Hardy on my tape.

1/7/66 The Matrix, San Francisco, California 
Comments: According to DeadBase X the following were played: 
Mindbender, On The Road Again, She Belongs To Me, I'll Go Crazy, 
Can't Come Down, Death Don't Have No Mercy, Parchman Farm, 
Midnight Hour, The Only Time Is Now, Early Morning Rain, It's All 
Over Now Baby Blue. No confirmation of the above on any recordings 
can be found. David Sorochty: The It's A Sin [2:52] and Sick and 
Tired [3:34] which circulate dated as "1/7/66" are just a partial copy of 
the "11/29/66 Set 1" (AKA 2/23/66) tape. The actual date of the full 
tape is unknown. These may really be "5/19/66". See the explanation 
of this on the "2/23/66"setlist. The fact that DeadBase has a list for 
1/7/66 which includes those two songs (in that order) is probably the 
reason for all the confusion in the first place. The 1/7/66 list has been 
in there since the first edition or two, but I don't know where they got 
it from. 

Recordings:: 7 SB. The two songs listed circulate in SBD.

1/15/66 Beaver Hall , Portland, Oregon 
Comments: Portland Acid Test -day uncertain. Owsley "Bear" 
Stanley: Portland acid test was either on Dec 18 '65, or Jan 15 '66. 
There were two which I didn't go to after my "initiation" at the Dec 
11 Muir Beach event, one was in Palo Alto and the other one was in 
Portland. There were two before that also. Only one other one did I 
miss, the first one in LA in late Feb in Northridge. So I missed a total 
of five of the AT's. The Dead were always the centerpiece of the Acid 
Tests, the real reason for its existence, and it could not have taken 
place without them. The band at the time rated their participation above 
any other activity in importance. Owsley later goes on to say: I met the 
Dead formally at the Fillmore show on 11 Feb '66. The Northridge 
Acid Test was 19 Feb, the Sunset Blvd. test was 25 Feb. I was not at 
the Northridge Test. Watts was in March.

Comments: Teddy GoodBear: According to Bear this show at The

therefore may not be accurate. Owsley "Bear" Stanley: There were 
only two Matrix shows, one in Dec '65, and the one before the Fillmore 
AT. The Matrix was a crummy little closet of a venue with barely 
enough room for 50 to 60 people to stand in, the big name bands didn't 
play there after they got up and known. The hall couldn't pay more 
than $100 for the act. They seldom had two acts/night and so far as I 
know never three. The Dead played there twice when they were 
unknown.

1/22/66 Longshoreman's Hall, San Francisco, California 
Comments: Trips Festival, As part of "The Acid Trip" -Other 
artist(s): Big Brother & The Holding Company. "A mutual friend 
asked Dick Latvala if he could shed any additional light on the above 
material". (SEE ??/??/66 -circulates from GDH #388), "and Dick 
answered that this was from a (7") reel that came out of a box that was 
only labeled "Longshoreman's." No date or any other information." I 
ask, could this "??/??/66" possibly be the same as this 1/22/66 show? 
Ken Babbs (From 'Taping Compendium'): We had this guy build us a 
soundboard; Buchla. He lived in San Francisco, California and he built 
us this thing called the Buchla Box. I think he worked on the Moog 
synthesizer. This guy was unbelievable. At the Trips Festival at 
Longshoreman's Hall [a venue with seats on all four sides of the floor], 
the weekend of January 22, 1966, he had ten speakers set up around 
there in the balcony. He had this board in which he could run the sound 
around in circles. He would isolate one, and have sound wheeling 
around the room. He had this thing like a piano that was just flat and 
you ran your fingers across it and it would play the notes. Made it 
himself, absoulutely fantastic. He made up this box for us that was 
essentially a mixer and a mike amp and a speaker box and an earphone 
box. Bear's Comments: were made off the top of his head & therefore 
may not be accurate. Owsley "Bear" Stanley: The box labeled 
"Longshoreman's" would have been the shows we did with Loading 
Zone in late April 66, after the return to SF from LA. To see SF

Comments: Acid Test LP. The Merry Pranksters with Jerry and 
Pigpen in attendance. Ken Babbs (From 'Taping Compendium'): This 
was not an Acid Test. Those were much bigger gatherings. This was 
done as a record to play at your house. With earphones on. It was done 
with that in mind. It was not an Acid Test. It was just us in the studio, 
doing our thing. Kesey and I and [fellow Merry Prankster] George 
[Foster] went in there and started laying this stuff down. The Grateful 
Dead had been playing Haight down at the Straight Theater. They 
came down and showed up. The real tragedy of all this is we must 
have been in there all night long, like six or eight hours. Jim the Host 
was responsible for editing down and mixing the session. But he took 
all the master tape and he made the tape that went into the record. Then 
those tapes got lost, destroyed, they're gone. And that guy's dead.

Comments: David Sorochty: "Supposedly a rehearsal, with multiple 
takes of various songs However, this is actually an edited copy of the 
Scorpio Studio outtakes tape (see 6/??/66). Steve McHenry provided a 
listing of the contents of his Questing Beast tape. It is: Side A -
Stealin' jam (very short, just a couple of bars) Stealin' jam (longer) 
Stealin (vocals) I Know You Rider (vocals) Don't Ease Jam (13 
times) Don't Ease (vocals) You Don't Have To Ask Jam (very brief) 
You Don't Have To Ask Jam (longer jam) You Don't Have To Ask 
(vocals) Tastebud Tastebud# (vocals, cut by tape flip) Side B -
Tastebud (vocals; started over from beginning) Cardboard Cowboy 
(vocals) I Know You Rider Jam I Know You Rider (vocals) Cold 
Rain Jam (I counted 10 of these, but was doing other things so may 
have miscounted by one; my jcard says 9) Cold Rain (vocals) Steve 
McHenry: I don't hear any talking between tunes on any of these; that 
is, nobody's counting off the various takes. The only speaking that is 
real obvious is at the end of the final Cold Rain where Jerry very 
plainly yells, after a few seconds, 'shit!'.

2/11/66 Youth Opportunities Center , Compton, California 
Set 1: Pigpen Rap (AKA -Nobody Cares Rap) 
Comments: Known as 'Watts Acid Test'. Circulates as 02/12/66, but 
unknown. Also see 03/??/66. What is most famous about the Watts 
test, is the "Who Cares" woman. Jeff Tiedrich: David Gans edited 
'Pigpen's Rap' and 'Schoolgirl>You Don't Love Me>Schoolgirl' 
together on GDH #388 (thus no splice) for the purposes of his 
broadcast. It should be noted that the date and location of the 'Pigpen 
Rap' is pure speculation. Dick Latvala informs us that the box and 7" 
reel from which this was taken is completely unlabelled. 
Transcription: The 'rap' starts with chattering and screaming in the 
background and Jerry (?) saying into the mike "Nobody Cares". You 
can hear Bobby and then Pigpen tells his 'story'. When Pig is done 
Bobby says "Someday Ron will take acid." Owsley "Bear" Stanley: 
The "Pigpen rap" that Gans took from an unlabeled box, with an intro 
from Jer "Nobody Cares" would have been an excerpt of a tape from 
the Watts Acid Test, or a show immediately after that gig. It is most 
likely, especially if there is a bunch of static on one channel (left I 
think), that it came from that Test. The Test, the third in LA, was in 
early March 1966. Owsley later goes on to say: This is absolutely the 
Watts Acid Test. There was a woman who Babbs was putting the mic 
onto who kept screaming "Who cares?" over and over at least a 
hundred times. I also think I recall the comment by Bobby on Pig's non 
acid-taking. There was a great Pig rap at that test, I would guess the 
tape was from the Prankster's tape machine. 
Recordings:: (?) FM. This segment was aired on David Gans's 
'Grateful Dead Hour' #388 and circulates in FM-SBD.

2/23/66 Unknown Venue 
Comments: See 5/19/66 for setlist. David Sorochty: The full tape is 
kind of a loop, with the same exact version of 'Sick And Tired' on it 
twice. The second time it fades out. I believe that 'It's A Sin' and 'Sick 
And Tired' which also circulate separately are incorrectly identified as 
"1/7/66". The fact that DeadBase has a list for "1/7/66" which includes 
It's A Sin and Sick And Tired (in that order) is probably the reason for 
all the confusion in the first place. The "1/7/66" list has been in there 
since the first edition or two, but I don't know where they got it from. 
Teddy GoodBear & David Sorochty: Set 1: Standing On The Corner 
[3:32]; Mindbender [2:51]; It Hurts Me Too [3:44]; Viola Lee Blues 
[7:24]; I Know You Rider [2:41]; It's A Sin [2:55]; Sick And Tired 
Sick and Tired [3:29] We suspect due to the set list similarity that this 
might really be from the show that DeadBase X calls "5/19/66", a 
show that was not listed in any of their previous editions. See 
"5/19/66" for further explanation. DeadBase X also has "2/23/66" with 
this setlist as well as, (previous editions prior to DeadBase X), list it 
under "11/29/66". Early Morning Rain and Cold Rain that circulate (as 
listed in DeadBase X) for this date are filler that do go with 
"11/29/66". See "11/29/66" for further explanation. Furthermore, 
DeadBase X footnotes --"Previously listed under"11/29/66"."

Set 2: The Same Thing (instrumental version) [7:06]; Death Don't

Comments: Pico Acid Test. David Sorochty: The unknown jam in the 
1st set sounds similar at times to You Don't Love Me, Hog For You 
Baby, Big Boy Pete, or even like Deep Elem Blues (the old way like 
on 12/1/66). This tape has apparently only recently (mid 1998) come 
into circulation. Another tape has been in circulation for years dated 
3/12/66 or 3/19/66 which contains Viola Lee Blues# (14.56), You See 
A Broken Heart (3.10), and Midnight Hour# (10.44). However this is 
not exactly a partial copy of 3/12/66. The versions of You See A 
Broken Heart and Midnight Hour# are the same as on the complete 
3/12/66, but the Viola Lee Blues is definitely a different version. So 
hold onto those older tapes. The full 3/12/66 tape does not have that 
voice that cuts in after You See A Broken Heart that says "RAW". I 
can't tell who that is or how it got there. David Dieterich: Bobby talks 
about the funky P.A. which is making popping noises after It's A Sin 
and BIODTL. Lots of talk about the ice cream man outside after the 1st 
set ends (after Next Time). 
Recordings:: SB. Midnight Hour cuts off with a significant portion 
missing. This tape also circulates (incorrectly) as 3/19/66.

Snow". Transcribed by Teddy GoodBear: Troupers Hall was the 
meeting room for a retired actor's club in Hollywood. The rent for the 
gig could'nt. have been much. We did everything ourselves, all in two 
days. We plastered handbills all over Hollywood. Stage decor was a 
few lengths of paisley cloth purchased that afternoon at a fabric store. 
For a box office, we had a card table and a cigar box. Our not-quitefull 
house must have had over a hundred people; and when the night 
was over, our net take was $75. At 2 o'clock in the morning, we went 
to Cantor's Deli on Fairfax and spent it all on dinner for everybody -with 
desert. --Grateful Dead Family Album (page 43).

4/28/6? Rock Garden, San Francisco, California 
Comments: Other artist(s): Charles Lloyd Quartet and Mystery Trend. 
Adrian M. Johnson: The caption lists this as "circa 1967"; the two 
other posters in "The Art Of Rock" from this venue are labelled as 
1966. The poster for the Dead actually says "April 28 -March 2", 
hence my guess it should be 4/28 -5/2. Information on the actual 
lifespans of the other groups or the venue which would help tie down 
the year would be welcomed. The artist (Michael Wood/Pyxis 
Studios). Teddy GoodBear: It's got to be '66, since we know for sure 
that on 4/29/67 the Dead were at "Earl Warren." David Sorochty: Well 
there are four most likely possibilities: #1 Should say April 28 -May 2 
and its 1967. This would conflict with other known shows. #2 Should 
say April 28 -May 2 and its 1966. This is possible -there is a gap in 
the known shows for that time period. It would mean the run was from 
Thursday to Monday. #3. Should say March 28 -April 2 and its 1967. 
This is possible -and this is what DeadBase has aparently assumed is 
the case. Maybe they have some other reason to believe that? That 
would mean that the run was from Tuesday to Sunday though. #4 
Should say March 28 -April 2 and its 1966. This is another possiblity. 
They were supposedly living in Los Angeles, California at the time, 
but it wouldn't conflict with the Los Angeles, California shows on the 
6th through 9th announced from the stage by Phil at 3-25-66 or any 
others for that matter. It would mean more back and forth traveling is 
all and it would explain the gap between the 3-25-66 show and the 
ones Phil was reminding people about -as though he was reminding 
them they are going to be back in LA in two weeks. This would be a 
Monday thru Saturday and would match the scheduling pattern of 
Monday thru Satuday of the other acts at this venue. This would in fact 
fit right in between the other two runs at the Rock Garden shown on 
the other two posters.

Set 1: Good Morning Little Schoolgirl [8:02] > You Don't Love Me 

[5:54] > Good Morning Little Schoolgirl [6:46#] 
Comments: Circulates as 02/12/66, but is unknown. Jeff Tiedrich: A 
mutual friend asked Dick Latvala if he could shed any additional light 
on the above material and Dick answered that this was from a 7" reel 
that came out of a box that was only labeled "Longshoreman's." No 
date or any other information. Transcribed by Teddy GoodBear from 
'The Taping Compendium':According to Vault archivist Dick Latvala, 
the material here comes from two different seven-inch reel boxes, the 
Pigpen rap in an unlabeled one, the other marked "Longshoreman's 
#1," with no other information. The intriguing thing is that both tapes 
have identical ambiences, and Bobby's comment has the same 
ambience and feel as the segment with Pigpen's rap. Owsley "Bear" 
Stanley: The box labeled "Longshoreman's" would have been the 
shows we did with Loading Zone in late April 66, after the return to SF 
from LA. 
Recordings:: 21 FM. This segment was aired on David Gans's 
'Grateful Dead Hour' #388 and circulates in FM-SBD. The very end 
of Good Morning Little Schoolgirl cuts off with a (minor?) portion 
missing.

Teddy GoodBear: The above setlists matches DeadBase X. Timings 
are from what DeadLists previously called "Set 1, 11/29/66" including 
Cream Puff War. Furthermore, DeadBase earlier editions prior to 
DeadBase X, also called "Set 1, 11/29/66". David Sorochty & Teddy 
GoodBear as per "2/23/66": Standing On The Corner, Mindbender, 
Hurts Me Too, Viola Lee Blues, I Know You Rider, It's A Sin and Sick 
And Tired -same order as "2/23/66" as listed in DeadBase X? If so, 
then we speculate that the right date is "5/19/66". 
Recordings:: 30 SB, assuming this is what DeadLists previously 
called 11/29/66; *otherwise* this does not circulate mid 1998. Cream 
Puff War cuts off with a significant portion missing. No recordings 
of "Set 2" are in circulation (mid 1998) to confirm DeadBase's list or to 
verify if it is the source tape for "2/23/66" or "11/29/66".

5/22/66 Rancho Olompali , Novato, California 
Comments: Transcribed by Teddy GoodBear: A rock & roll oasis just 
off Highway 101 in Navato, Rancho Olompali was where the Grateful 
Dead, the Diggers, the Angels, the Black Panthers and the San 
Francisco, California music scene went to dance after a head-banging 
week in the city. The Grateful Dead were each paid twenty-five 
dollars a week in those days and gigged wherever they could, often 
five days a week. An incredible freedom cruised through each day like 
a tide. The Jefferson Airplane, It's A Beautiful Day, Country Joe & The 
Fish, The Sons of Champlin, Quicksilver Messenger Service, The 
Charlatans, Big Brother & the Holding Company... Weekend free-
form celebrations of whatever anyone wished to celebrate, beginning in 
party clothes at the main house, ending naked in the sunshine by the 
pool. In addition to the Harley-scaled acreage, a huge outdoor oven 
cranked non-stop. It was the Diggers baking their daily bread to give 
away later in the park. As each participant got coated with flour, 
ghostly apparitions would leap from the oven to the pool, long hair 
flying in the wind. It was an easy scene for music and lovers, bands 

interwove and produced moments that were as high as they get. -Grateful 
Dead Family Album (page 33). Transcribed by Teddy 
GoodBear: The Dead used to have some pretty good parties out at 
their place in the country, in Olompali. Two or three hundred people 
would come, and of course, most of them probably took LSD. This 
was around the time that a lot of new ground was being broken 
socially, and it seemed like a third to half the people at these parties 
would be naked, hanging around the pool. It was a great place. It was 
sort of a ranch estate that had a nice big house that looked kind of like 
Tara in 'Gone With The Wind'. Then there was a lot of land around it -hills, 
a creek in the back, a big lawn and the pool. It was maybe 1000 
feet off the highway, so it was fairly secluded. In between the house 
and the pool the Dead would set up their equipment and play from time 
to time during the day. Usually there'd be members of other bands 
there too, like the Airplane and Quicksilver, and there'd be little jams 
with people who wanted to play. I remember that the Dead would be 
playing and Neal Cassady would be doing this strange little dance --it 
was almost like breakdancing; very fluid. Out on the lawn there was 
this very far-out configuration of plumbing that was once part of a 
sprinkler system or something. It stuck out of the ground and stood 
maybe five feet high. I could'nt. figure out what the hell it was for. It 
was just a mess of pipes with faucets coming out of it that had been 
modified over the years. Very strange. So the Dead would be playing, 
and Neal would be dancing on the lawn with this bizarre metal partner. 
He'd dance around it, with it really. He had some pretty good moves, 
too. Neal was always in the thick of things. Those parties --I'm not 
sure how many of them there were --were always on a nice afternoon. 
Everyone would play all day in the sunshine --just doing everything -and 
then when the sun would start to go down and it got cold, people 
would pack it in. By the time it was dark most people were gone, but 
there were always enough people who were either around to begin with 
or who wanted to stay, so that the party would continue inside. In fact, 
with the number of people hanging out there all the time, it was pretty 
much a party all the time anyway. I don't. know if it was 24 hours a 
day, but every time I was there it was going. --George Hunter (The 
Golden Road). Grateful Dead Faimly Album (page 33).

David Sorochty: This circulates as 2/5/66, 6/??/66, as well as 7/??/66. 
The list in DeadBase X is incomplete. This tape consists of numerous 
renditions of most of the songs and they usually are without vocals. 
This is definitely from recording studio sessions since there is a take 
number spoken quietly before most of them. This is what is on my 
copy of the Scorpio Studios outtakes tape which came dated as 2/??/66: 
Tape #1 -Side A Stealin' takes 4 and 5 Stealin' take 6 (vocals) I 
Know You Rider take 1 (vocals) Don't Ease Me In takes 1 through 8 
Don't Ease Me In takes 1 through 5 Don't Ease Me In take 6 (vocals) 
Don't Ease Me In takes 7 and 8# (cut) You Don't Have To Ask take 13 
You Don't Have To Ask take 14 (vocals) Tastebud take 1 Side B -
Tastebud take 2 (vocals) Cardboard Cowboy takes 1 through 4 
Cardboard Cowboy take 5 (vocals) Stealin' take 1 I Know You Rider 
take 1 I Know You Rider take 2 (vocals) Cold Rain And Snow (8 
times with no take numbers announced) Tape #2 -Side A Cold Rain 
And Snow (no take number announced) Cold Rain And Snow (vocals, 
no take number announced) Cold Rain And Snow# (cut, no take 
number announced). This also included the following on side A of the 
second tape: 1966 Studio (identified as possibly from the Scorpio 
sessions also) -Lindy (vocals) Alice D. Millionaire (vocals) (see the 
??/??/66 listing for more information on those) as well as these obvious 
filler songs; 1969 studio -I'm A Lovin Man (Pigpen and Weir 
vocals, Garcia pedal steel & John Tenney on fiddle) Instrumental 
(Bucky's Tune) An edited version of this circulates as "2/5/66 Questing 
Beast Rehearsal". Based on the list provided by Steve McHenry we 
can see that the differences are that the Questing Beast tape does not 
include: a) takes 7 and 8# of Don't Ease Me In (both are instrumental 
versions) b) Cardboard Cowboy (takes 1 through 4 without vocals) c) 
Stealin' take 1 (instrumental) d) Cold Rain And Snow# (the very last 
one) e) the additional material that was identified as possibly being 
from the Scorpio recording sessions (Lindy, and Alice D. Millionaire) 

f)the obvious filler material which was identified as being from 1969 (
I'm A Lovin Man and the instrumental referred to as Bucky's Tune). 
Steve's notes indicate that his Questing Beast tape has a brief You 
Don't Have To Ask which I have not noted on my full Scorpio tape. It 
is probably on the Scorpio tape and I just missed it. Steve has also 
reported that his tape does not have the take number spoken before 
each rendition as on the Scorpio tape. With the take numbers edited out 
and the filler removed in order to squeeze this all onto one tape, it 
might give the impression that this is a practice session. See the 45's 
produced under the "Scorpio" labels:

Comments: Multiple versions of Viola Lee Blues with Pigpen and

January or February '66. Dick Latvala -According to DeadLists 
Digests #534: ftp://gdead.berkeley.edu/pub/gdead/setlists/
DEADLIST_PROJECT/digest-archive/v01.n534, when reading 
comments of 7/3/66: Dick Latvala has crossed out "it's a good thing" 
and written "MESS UP A GOOD THING CARDBOARD 
COWBOY". Is this the real name of the song we call "Cardboard 
Cowboy"? Or did Dick forget to put a comma after 'Mess Up A 
Good Thing' and the next song would be 'Carboard Cowboy'? SEE 
(7/3/66). Owsley "Bear" Stanley: I do not recall there ever being any 
song called "Cardboard Cowboy". I cannot imagine what song the 
reference is to.

7/??/66 Western Recording, California 
Set 1: Stealin'; Don't Ease Me In 
Comments: Scorpio 45 RPM record. July 1966 release, but the actual 
date of the recording is more than likely sometime in June. See the 
above info listed under 6/??/66 and 2/5/66. From 'Taping 
Compendium': Gene Estribou had the first four-track in the San 
Francisco, California area, Buena Vista Studio, and here the Dead cut 
their first demo in June 1966. He was introduced to the Dead by 
photographer Herb Greene, when the band was playing in Palo Alto 
and Garcia still played bluegrass. Gene Estribou: First we had an 
Ampex three-channel instrumentation deck that Henry Jacobs brought 
into the studio. I had built a big horn and a studio and we had good 
condenser mikes and spent a lot of time optimizing the board. We went 
down to Western Recording and used their studio for doing some tapes 
that ended up being on the first 45 from Scorpio... Michael Wanger: ‘ 
Teddy, Thanks for your inquiry. Here's a bit of history: I met Bob 
Weir while attending Menlo School for Boys in 1961. Through Bob, I 
met his good friend, Vance Frost. Bob and I pursued our mutual 
interest in folk music and eventually performed together in a band 
called "The Uncalled Four." During the summer of 1964, while Vance 
and I were traveling around the country living out of a '56 Chevy 
station wagon, my brother, Peter Wanger, made a recording of Mother 
McCree's Uptown Jug Champions at Top of the Tangent in Palo Alto. 
Many years later, while attending Stanford University, I had a radio 
program for which I produced a series of documentaries on various 
aspects of the sixties' folk and rock and roll scene. After several 
programs, I asked my friend Vance to accompany me on air in order to 
provide a little more liveliness to the program. This approach was so 
successful that we decided to take it to the next step. We approached 
KSAN's Program Director, Tom Donahue, with the idea of producing 
similar documentaries for KSAN. We wanted to start with Grateful 

Dead because we knew some of the band members and had the 
McCree recording. Donahue gave us an official go-ahead, so in the 
late fall and early winter of 1968 we began our interviews. We met 
with the entire band at Alembic, the band's Marin "clubhouse" as they 
called it, and recorded everyone but Pigpen who declined to be 
interviewed. We got such great stuff that we charged ahead with 
interviews of John Cipollina and David Freiberg of Quicksilver 
Messenger Service, Paul Kantner and Spencer Dryden of Jefferson 
Airplane and Ralph J. Gleason, the jazz critic for the S. F. Chronicle 
who was a strong advocate for the new music that was coming out of 
San Francisco, California. Starting in early 1969, we began putting the 
pieces together using the equipment at Golden State Recorders where 
Vance worked as an engineer. To fill out the early part of Grateful 
Dead's music history, we requested some early recordings:. Rock 
Sculley gave us the first two singles, "Stealin'" and "Don't Ease Me In," 
along with some Fillmore recordings from 1966. We made copies and 
returned the originals to the Dead. The tape box labels featured on page 
104 of the "The Deadhead's Taping Compendium" is our label for 
those tapes. The documentary aired on KSAN in June, 1969. I guess 
there was an assumption, based on those box labels, that Vance and I 
had made some early recordings of Grateful Dead. Well, sad to say, it 
never happened. Currently, I am working with Grateful Dead 
Productions on an Enhanced CD of the McCree recording. The 
multimedia portion will contain a 1964 interview with Jerry, Bob and 
other band members. I also expect to include the first 11 minutes of the 
documentary which traces Grateful Dead's history up through their jug 
band period. Well, Teddy, it's been fun dredging up all these memories. 
Please let me know if you have any questions. Best, Michael Wanger

7/3/66 Fillmore Auditorium, San Francisco, California 
Set 1: Dancin' In The Street [7:17]; I Know You Rider [1:49#]; He 
Was A Friend Of Mine [#6:55]; Next Time You See Me [2:56]; Viola 
Lee Blues [7:21]; Big Boss Man [3:29]; Sittin' On Top Of The World 
[2:32#] 
Comments: "Independence Ball" -Other artist(s): Love & Group B. 
David Sorochty: Most tapes have the song order listed in Deadbase 9 
and earlier editions, which is incorrect. The correct song order is what's 
listed above. Our tapes seem to come from two shorter tapes which 
overlap a bit at the beginning of Viola Lee Blues. Here's what's on my 
DAT tape which comes from a low gen reel: 7/3/66 Part 1 -some of 
the between song talking, then: Viola Lee Blues Big Boss Man Sittin' 
On Top of The World# Filler (Scorpio 45 RPM): Don't Ease Me In 
Stealin' 7/3/66 Part 2: Dancin' In The Streets I Know You Rider# 
#He Was A Friend Of Mine Next Time You See Me all of the 
between song talking intact with no splice and then: Viola Lee Blues# 
(cuts out after just a minute or so) It is apparent that chronologically 
what I call Part 2 comes first, then Part 1 -they just overlap a bit on 
the beginning of Viola Lee. Most cassette tapes in circulation have the 
above order with the Scorpio filler moved to the end (sometimes the 
Viola Lee overlap part is intact, other times it is cut off). A few tapes in 
circulation have Part 2 first and then Part 1 with the overlap removed 
(which I believe is the right order) and the Scorpio filler last. 
DeadBase X does list what I believe is the correct song order and also 
lists several more songs which do not circulate. They are: Unknown, 
Minglewood, Cold Rain, Unknown, BIODTL, Cream Puff War & It's 
A Good Thing." Dick Latvala -According to DeadLists Digests #534: 
ftp://gdead.berkeley.edu/pub/gdead/setlists/
DEADLIST_PROJECT/digest-archive/v01.n534 Dick Latvala 
has crossed out "it's a good thing" and written "MESS UP A GOOD 
THING CARDBOARD COWBOY". Is this the real name of the song 
we call "Cardboard Cowboy"? Or did Dick forget to put a comma after 
'Mess Up A Good Thing' and the next song would be 'Carboard 
Cowboy'? Thayer Jennings: "My reasoning for listing He Was A 
Friend Of Mine and Next Time before Viola Lee:* I have three 
different copies of this --two of the three are similar to the DeadBase 
listing (i.e. with Friend Of Mine and Next Time at the end of the set)... 
but the last copy came to me mislabeled as "04/23/66 San Fran"... but it 
is actually this (07/03/66). The set list on this third copy is the same as 
I've listed above (cutting in on Friend Of Mine and cutting out during 
Top Of The World). The key 'dead air' segment --between Next Time 
and Viola Lee is intact. There is a small bit of conversation between 
the two (which partially exists on my other copies): Next Time > 
applause > Garcia [to band]: "Had to do it man. I had to do it." 
(laughter) "I just had to do it, you know how it is." (pause, but no 
splice) Pigpen [to Garcia (or band)]: "Viola Lee Blues". Garcia [to 
audience]: "We had a request for this... before... before we did it. And 
uh..." Lesh(?) [in background, to band]: "I don't know, man. I can't tell 
by this...(?)" Garcia [continuing, to audience]: "...and... it's called 
Viola Lee Blues." Weir(?): "Aww, no..."> Viola Lee Blues." 
DeadBase X [under 'mislabelled tapes']: Many copies of this have four 
additional songs after Next Time You See Me. Stealin' and Don't. Ease 
are from the Scorpio Records single. Lindy is from 'Historic Dead' and 
Baby Blue is from 'Vintage Dead'. This tape is sometimes dated 9/4/66. 
DeadBase X [under 'Tape Timings']: There is a silver of Don't. Ease 
introduction that cuts almost immediately between Top Of The World 
and Dancin'. Before Viola Lee Blues --Jerry: "We had a request for 
this before... before we did it. It's called Viola Lee Blues." Bobby: 
"Oooh Nooo!" Before I Know You Rider --Jerry:"Along with our 
previous dedication dedicating this evening's sets on our part to the 
Sundancers in Ignatio, Colorado, we'd also like to dedicate a certain 
portion of this to Mnasidika, this little clothes store, you know, down 
on Haight Street that has some things and it's all right, and it's all 
right... indeed. We'd like to continue along the same happy vein... with 
another song, no doubt." I Know You Rider cuts during the “muddy 
Water" verse. The beginning of He Was A Friend Of Mine is cut. 
Recordings:: 34 SB. The complete list circulates in SBD. The 
beginning of He Was A Friend Of Mine is clipped with an 
indeterminate portion missing. Sittin' On Top Of The World cuts off 

with a significant portion missing. The end of I Know You Rider cuts 
off with a significant portion missing. Also (consult vault sources)

the band before Viola Lee Blues: "The oldest juveniles in the state of 
California: the Grateful Dead." Viola Lee Blues timing includes the 

[0:07] 'intro'. When the 'intro' occurred seems to be in debate. Some 
say the 2nd set, others say after two songs and others what we have 
listed above. David Gans, as indicated below, seems to say that what is 
listed above as set 2 comes first on the tapes he found and that it is the 
tail end of set 1. David Gans posted to r.m.gd about these shows:

start of that 7/17 set, and there was another 7/17 tape that was unusable 
because of damage to the reel. There is also a nice long Cream Puff

One additional song from set 1 (#He Was A Friend Of Mine before 
Cream Puff War [GDH #501]) and one more song from set 2 (Dancin# 
follows Baby Blue) are on the reels David Gans got from his friend, 
but are not listed in DeadBase and do not circulate. Midnight Hour 
which DeadBase lists as the version with Joan Baez & Mimi Farina is 
not on these reels. This Midnight Hour was previously listed as being 
8/7/66. See listing for "9/11/66" for more info. DeadBase X [under 
'Tape Timings']: After Viola Lee Blues --Phil: "That was a song about 
jail. This is a song about... well... No, it's a funny song." Before You 
Don't. Have To Ask --Jerry: "Any of you folks right in the first few 
rows here have a match?" Phil: "Oh here."

9/11/66 Fillmore Auditorium, San Francisco, California 
Comments: BOTH AND Jazz Club Benefit -"Gigantic All-Night 
Jazz/Rock Dance Concert". Other artist(s): John Hendricks Trio, Elvin 
Jones, Joe Henderson Quartet, Big Mama Thornton, Denny Zeitlin 
Trio, Jefferson Airplane, The Great Society and The Wildflower. 
Recordings:: See 9/16/66. Really the same show as what is listed as 
"9/16/66", but this is from the SBD tape for the albums, not vinyl. The 
Midnight Hour from this tape (cut off at about 12 mins due to the tape 
flip) circulates separately labeled incorrectly as "8/7/66 w/ Joan Baez 
& Mimi Farina". They are not on this one -really.

The MGM Sun LP "Vintage Dead" (Sun-5001) contains 
SIDE A: I Know You Rider 4:25, It Hurts Me Too 4:17, It's All Over 
Now Baby Blue 4:50, Dancin In The Street 7:55; SIDE B: In The 
Midnight Hour 18:23. Timings are off the album. The liner notes 
describe the material as coming from "The Avalon Ballroom, San 
Francisco, California in San Francisco, California 1966." This list has 
always appeared in DeadBase under the date 9/16/66, with a note 
saying actual date for list unknown." I have a 45-minute cassette side 
of this material running from I Know You Rider through the first half 
or so of Midnight Hour. I got it from a friend up in Portland OR 10 
years ago. He won his copy as a prize in a radio contest from a radio 
show up there called Fillmore Northwest. The tape was described to 
him as being off the reels of this material, not off the LP --and that's 
what it sounds like. The tape he received was dated 9/11/66. As noted, 
the Midnight Hour from this date also circulates mislabeled with 
several other dates, including 8/7/66. 
Recordings:: 50 SB(LP), 60 SB(LP). The complete list circulates in 
SBD. The very beginning of Schoolgirl is clipped with possibly 1-2 
secs missing.

11/??/66 KFRC Studios, San Francisco, California 
Comments: KFRC radio source. Interview, but no songs other than 
commercially released material. According to Garcia's statements in 
the interview, the interview took place sometime during the latter part 
of 1966. The transcription of the interview can be seen at: 
http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Palms/2635/interview66.html 
Tom Ordon: In early 1967, I taped an interview with the Grateful 
Dead that was being re-broadcast on KFRC in San Francisco, 
California. It was originally broadcast on KFRC in November, 1966. 
The disc jockey was Steve O'Shea and the program was called "KFRC 
Perspective". The length of the interview is 22 minutes and 22 seconds 
long. No songs were played. I am certain that David Gans has the 
whole thing because he stopped by my home in Dallas, Texas, in the 
late seventies, primarily to record it. He gave me credit in the back of 
his book, "Playing in the Band", for supplying the tape. David 
Sorochty: It begins with a pre-recorded radio station item which is like 
a choir singing the numbers of the year out like this: Nineteeeeen 
Sixty-Siiiiiiiiiiix! The interview begins and Jerry, Pigpen, Billy, and 
Bob are present. Phil is not and they say he had an errand to run or 
something like that. There is a mention that the band has been together 
for about a year now. The interviewer says that he has seen them a few 
times at the Fillmore. They mention that there are fans during the 
interview. There is talk of Pigpen T-shirts being available and that the 
picture of him on the front of the shirt may have been on a Family Dog 
concert poster. They give the interviewer a complementary Pigpen T-
shirt and he says he'll have to figure out somewhere to wear it! The 
whole thing is 6 mins 47 secs long. Right in the last second of the 
interview the song Good Morning Little Schoolgirl is cross-faded in as 
the last words of the interview fade out. Schoolgirl gets cut after 47 
seconds. This version seemed unusually clean and sounded a lot like a 
prerecorded studio recording. On a hunch, I cued this up with my CD 
of the first album and discovered that this is actually the version on the 
first album. I am positive it is a match. Since we know for sure the 
interview was in 1966, and the first album wasn't recorded till 1967, 
the Schoolgirl is something that was obviously tacked on later by 
someone and is unrelated to the interview. 
Recordings:: 22 FM, Tom Ordon reel (7 1/2 ips mono).

Comments: Thayer Jennings: Bill Graham introduces the band 
before Cold Rain And Snow -(cut)"...igpen, on organ and vocals; on 
the left, rhythm guitar and vocals, Mister Bob Weir; on bass and 
vocals, Mister Philip Lesh; on drums, in striped t-shirt, Mister Bill 
Summer; on the far left, on lead guitar and vocals, the Charles Atlas of 
the psychedelic set; the Grateful Dead." The reasoning for listing Cold 
Rain before Hi-Heel Sneakers -* The tape is ordered this way --there 
*is* a splice between Cold Rain andHi-Heel Sneakers, but *not* 
between Pain I.M.H and BIODTL. * Bill Graham's intro is before 
Cold Rain. Would the introduction have come *after* a couple 
songs??? (I kind of doubt it). DeadBase X [under 'Tape Timings']: 
After Pain In My Heart --Pigpen: "Thank you." Before BIODTL --?: 
"It's Over." --Jerry: "It seems like it's just begun. What can I say here 
after I say this? Good evening. The number tonight... everybody check 
your coupons... The lucky number tonight is ten." Phil: "What? Hey, 
wait a minute, How many?" Jerry: How many? Eleven? Eleven. 
Pardon me." Phil: "The magic number is eleven." BIODTL --11 beats. 
Short tuning ditty before He Was A Friend. Tape cuts into and out of 
Teddy Bear's Picnic before Smokestack. After Midnight Hour -Pigpen: 
"Thank You." David Sorochty: Filler on tape -unidentified 
You See A Broken Heart, is from 3/12/66. The common tapes, 
including mine, have this order: Hi-Heel Sneakers, Pain In My Heart, 
------splice----Cold Rain And Snow ----splice------Beat It On Down 
The Line, Cream Puff War, Same Thing, He Was A Friend Of Mine, 
(Dancin' In The Street is missing). In fact I had always thought that 
was the right order. I never doubted it and that is how its been listed in 
DeadBase too. Notice that there is a splice right before and after Cold 

Grateful Dead live performances 1959 – 1995 

-17



Rain And Snow and that intoduction is missing. I'm willing to accept 
that my tape was out of order and it also had the intro cut out. But 
something about that seemed strange because I was absolutely positive 
that I had heard at least part of that "Charles Atlas" introduction before. 
But how could that be possible? I've only ever had one copy of 
11/19/66 and its not on there. Then I saw a post from Bart Wise where 
he said in regards to 2/12/67: "I checked out my copy of 2/12/67 last 
night. Mine also has the Smokestack in between the other two songs 
and runs: Bill Graham Intro -no audible cut-, Cold Rain and Snow % 
-cuts in-, Smokestack Lightning -cuts out-, % -cuts in-Hi Heeled 
Sneakers. Bill Graham's intro is chopped up and reads: '...and on the 
far left...and on the lead guitar and vocals...the Charles Atlas of the 
psychedelic set...the Grateful Dead.' and without an audible cut, Cold 
Rain and Snow." There it was again, the "Charles Atlas" introduction 
right before Cold Rain And Snow with no splice. That was exactly 
where I recalled hearing it from -my 2/12/67 tape! It didn't seem likely 
that the same intro would be used twice right before they start playing 
the same song. I wondered if 2/12/67 might be a bogus mislabeled 
partial copy of 11/19/66? Even though I didn't have the intro on my 
11/19/66 tape I compared the two versions of just the song Cold Rain 
And Snow by cueing them up so they were in perfect sync with each 
other and listening to them simultaneously. I did this several times and 
found that they are note for note identical. The real clincher was at the 
very end of the song in the last second or so there is some yelling from 
the audience that is also on both tapes which occurs just as it quiets 
down, but before the music finally stops. You can just barely hear it, 
but two people yell out what sounds like "Hey" and "Yeah" in quick 
succession. It sounds almost like one word "HeyYeah". Its kind of hard 
to hear, but its there on both tapes. These are definitely the same 
versions. I then checked the two versions of Hi-Heeled Sneakers and 
there is some reverb at the beginning of 2/12/67 which is not on 
11/19/66 (this was mentioned by Bart). The reverb dies down after a 
minute or less though for the most part. Aside from that they do seem 
to be played the exact same way on both tapes. In fact there is one time 
where Jerry sings the word "Sneakers" and his voice kind of catches 
and cracks a little. That is definitely on both tapes which is kind of odd 
in itself. I checked the two versions of Smokestack and those seemed 
at first to be close, but the 2/12/67 Smokestack runs slow compared to 
the one from 11/19/66. They do definitely come from the same time 
frame where they played the song the same exact way. Even all of the 
ooo-oohs and aaah-aaahs from Pigpen match up just right. The speed 
difference is significant and again I wouldn't jump to the conclusion 
that they are the very same rendition but they are at least very close 
time frame wise. Smokestack gets cut off on 2/12/67 so you can't check 
for some strange identifiable yells from the audience right at the end of 
the song. The interesting thing is that 2/12/67 has been around for a 
long time and 11/19/66 just came out of hiding all of a sudden at the 
same time as 3/18/67 did back in 1989. (I checked the Smokestack on 
3/18/67 and its not the same as the one on 2/12/67 for sure). The 
bottom line is that I'm convinced "2/12/67" is some sort of a 
compilation tape. I'm convinced that the intro, Cold Rain And Snow 
and Hi-Heeled Sneakers are definitely from 11/19/66. However the 
Smokestack (which might actually be a studio recording) seems to be 
played *very* similarly to the version on 11/19/66, but there may be 
some differences and no clincher to really prove it is the same as the 
11/19/66 version. Maybe some other tape will show up from this time 
frame which will turn out to be the real source for that song. Other 
artist(s): James Cotton Blues Band, Lothar & The Hand People.

David Sorochty & Teddy GoodBear: The list in Deadbase is incorrect. 
Early Morning Rain and Cold Rain And Snow are before Viola Lee 
Blues in set 2 of this show, not the "2/23/66" tape. Source for Cream 
Puff War as listed as set 1 in DeadBase X unidentified (see 5/19/66). 
Some cassettes in circulation do have the songs as listed in Deadbase 

X. David Sorochty & Teddy GoodBear recap of DeadBase X: 
DeadBase X and our notations in parenthesis -Set 1: Cream Puff War. 
(see 5/19/66) Set 2: Same as DeadLists Set 2 (see above 11/29/66), 
except DeadBase X do not list 'Early Morning' & 'Cold Rain'. They 
list it on 2/23/66. Set 3: Same as DeadLists Set 3 (see above 
11/29/66). DeadBase Footnote: This is probably from more than one 
show, dates unknown. (1) "Merry-Go-Round Broke Down" tuning 
after 'I Just Want'. DeadBase X [under 'mislabelled tapes']: Tapes with 
this date are a mixture of at least two shows which may actually all be 
from the Matrix. The time frame of this material seems to span from 
January to December of 1966. Sometimes this tape shows up dated 
2/23/66. We have this date listed as "location unknown" but whether 
the Dead actually played that night remains a mystery. David 
Sorochty: Here is *some* of the in-between talking that should clarify 
the sets and the reason why I'm sure that Early Morning Rain and Cold 
Rain And Snow really do go where we say they do -Side A -SET 2: 
Jerry: "I'd like to start off the second set with a Cowboy song." ?: 
"Cowboy song." Jerry: "Cowboy song." Me And My Uncle, Same 
Thing. Jerry: "an old jug band song -it's called Stealin'" Jerry: "just 
Stealin'" Stealin' Jerry: "thank you"?: "Ha, ha, ha" Jerry: "gonna do a 
rock and roll song" Jerry: "famous old rock and roll song" Bobby: "for 
all you old geezers" Big Boy Pete Jerry: "thank you" Jerry: "So 
much for our lights" One Kind Favor ?: "Jerry" Bobby: "We 
already did that one." Jerry: "We're changing our name to comedy 
relief."?: "comic relief" Jerry: "We're changing your name to... uh 
comic relief"?: "Cold Rain and Snow" Jerry: "No, no -Early Morning

Rain first"?: "ha, ha, ha" Jerry: "I can't do it -I'm sick" Jerry: "Early 
Morning Rain? Early Morning Rain?" Pigpen: "Get outta here" Jerry: 
"Who's that out there?" various: "Marty, Marty, hey Marty, Marty, 
Marty" Jerry: "Yeah, with a half step then" Phil: "We're telling all our 
secrets" Early Morning Rain Jerry: "Doesn't sound at all like you 
remembered it -does it Marty?" Jerry: "thank you kindly" Phil: 
"Nurse -could we have another Coca Cola up here please?" Jerry: "I 
could have done it too" Cold Rain And Snow ?: "Have another 
Coke."?: "...next" Jerry: "Viola Lee Blues": "yeah" Side B: Jerry: 
"What are you having to drink Phil?" Phil: "Just plain Coke, plain old 
Coke" Jerry: "Plain old, good old, happy old Coca Cola." Bobby?: "If 
you will." Pigpen: "Ever feel like you needed windshield wipers on 
your contact lenses?" Jerry: "Can't make it work -how do you make it 
work?" Jerry: "Ouch!" ?: "Want a chair to stand on Jerry?" ?: "All 
right what is it?"?: "Hey that's pretty good" Jerry: "I like that" Jerry: 
"The name of this song is -uh -Viola -Lee -Blues Viola Lee Blues 
?: "thank you" Jerry: "That's the end of the second set, we'll be back a 
little later with the third set; the third and final set. In other words that 
set was the second to the final set." Set 3: Down So Long Jerry: 
"thank you" Something On Your Mind?: "thank you" Lindy, Good 
Morning Little Schoolgirl Pigpen: "thank you" I Just Want To Make 
Love To You Jerry: "Well it's about that time again" Merry-Go-Round 
tuning Pigpen: "Bye -we all knew that part" Jerry: "In spite of it 
all...." I have no doubt that this is all one show. In fact there really isn't 
any reason to think that it's not. It's just that we only have (mid 1998) 
tapes of sets 2 and 3 (and they really are sets 2 and 3). Maybe set 1 was 
never recorded or its just that it doesn't circulate if it does exist. I also 
know why DeadBase does their lists the way they do: First as I 
described above I think they have one of the 2/23/66 tapes with the 
Early Morning Rain and Cold Rain And Snow from 11/29/66 added on 
as filler. Second there are some tapes of 11/29/66 Sets 2 and 3 that are 
missing Early Morning Rain and Cold Rain And Snow on side A and 
have #Viola Lee at the end of side A instead (without the in between 
talking) and then just set 3 on side :B. That version is missing the 
talking before Viola Lee that is key to understanding that those other 
two songs fit in where they do and this really is all one show. Without 
the continuing talk about requesting Coca Colas before and after Cold 
Rain And Snow and also before the complete Viola Lee Blues you 
wouldn't know that. That is what they must have and that is why their 
lists are like that. I have the better more complete version of 11/29/66 
Sets 2 and 3. I also had one of the other versions. I have never had a 
copy with Cream Puff War that cuts at the beginning of side A on my 
11/29/66. I do kind of wonder where it really goes, that is the only 
thing in doubt. It is possible that it is only on some 2/23/66 tapes but 
I'm not sure of that. Maybe the DeadBase folks saw a set 2 and 3 from 
one show and this other set that looked kind of like a set 1 and they 
combined them in their books for a while. I think that is the source of 
all the confusion. The doubt about 11/29/66 being from a single show 
is just in their minds because they don't have the most complete copy 
where you can figure this out.

Set 1: Me and My Uncle (1) 
Comments: (1) David Sorochty: 

Me And My Uncle is often found as filler on circulating cassettes, of 
12/1/66, *twice* after Alice D. Millionaire. They begin Me And My 
Uncle and play it for a minute or two and then it gets all messed up 
and they come to a stop. They screwed it up and Jerry explains "We 
can't agree where this is gonna go" or something close to that. After 
some confusion they begin Me And My Uncle again and this time they 
play it to completion. Neither the false start rendition or the one which 
comes to a finish are duplication of the set 3 Me And My Uncle which 
is part of the 12/1/66 show. In addition, this little clip is not duplication 
of any other currently (1998) circualting 1966 or early 1967 show. Its 
source and exact date of origin remains unknown.

Thayer Jennings: Again, this is obviously more than a single show. The 
only exception to DeadBase X --I didn't list the (1st set) Me & My 
Uncle (between Alice D. Millionaire and Cream Puff War) --my tape 
flips after Alice D.M... side B begins with Cream Puff War --so I can't 
tell what (if anything) might be between them. David Sorochty: Me 
And My Uncle is often found as filler on circulating cassettes *twice* 
after Alice D. Millionaire. They begin Me And My Uncle and play it 
for a minute or two and then it gets all messed up and they come to a

currently (1998) circualting 1966 or early 1967 show. Its source and 
exact date of origin remains unknown. Right before they begin the 3rd 
set Jerry says something like "this is the last set of out last appearance 
on a Thurday at The Matrix" or something close to that.

12/2/66 Pauley Ballroom, U. of California, Berkeley, California 
Comments: 'Danse Macabre' -Other artist(s): Country Joe & The 
Fish. Matt Schofield: Evidence that there was at least a planned show 
for this night. The below was sent to me from Rob Weiner of "The 
Annotated Bibliography by David Dodd and Rob Weiner" located at: 

http://info.greenwood.com/books/0313301/0313301417.html 
This bibliography is an ideal research tool for someone with some time 
and access to newspaper vaults. But that's maybe something that will 
have to wait until all those newspaper articles are online. This from 
the SF Chronicle of 12.1.66. Small article on page 46. With a picture 
of Garcia and Pigpen. (One word is illegible on the photocopy that I 
have -but it really does say 'Pen is the lead singer'). "From A Jug" 
"Jerry Garcia, left, and Pig Pen are a [?] two fifth of the Grateful Dead, 
the blues-rock group which will play a dance concert at 9 tomorrow 
night at Pauley Ballroom, University of California. Garcia is the lead 
guitarist, Pen is lead singer and plays harmonica and organ. The group, 
which has been in existence for about 16 months, is one of the two 
most popular organizations in the Bay Area. It evolved out of a jug 
band which included Garcia, Pen and Bob Weir, the Dead's rhythm 
guitarist. Phil Lesh is the bassist, Bill Sommers is the drummer."

Comments: "The Great Human Be-In" -afternoon concert. Other

Charlatans". *Charles Lloyd on flute on GMLS.Transcribed by Glenn 
Gillis: Best of all were the glorious free concerts in the Panhandle --a 
flatbed truck, makeshift electricity, food, wine, friends, sunshine, and 
some wonderful bands who hadn't hit the big time yet. At first it 
seemed amazing that we knew by name so many of the hundreds 
gathered; but as the months went by, our awareness of a larger 
community grew until it peaked that fine day in January of 1967, the 
day of the Tribal Stomp at the Polo Fields to be known as the "Human 
Be In." We heard it through the grapevine, and a half dozen of us 
started early that morning to walk the couple of miles to the park. As 
we walked along Lincoln Avenue, we noticed other groups of 
neighbors walking in the same direction. More joined in off side 
streets, and by the time we turned north into the park, we were a large, 
laughing group. A half mile later, we were a horde and as the Be-In 
took shape through the day, we were awed and thrilled as the Polo 
Fields filled up with more than 20,000 people. It was a day of 
innonence and hope; and in many ways the last moments of naivete for 
a neighborhood that had just gone public. --Rosie McGee from:

David Sorochty: A short while ago I mentioned that I received a tape 
from David Dieterich which had on it some undated filler which 
included an unknown instrumental version of Viola Lee Blues. I 
listened carefully to that bit and here's what I got: Midnight Hour 

(13.17)Viola Lee Blues# (4.10) instrumental version #Good Morning 
Little Schoolgirl (0.27) (with flute) When I heard the flute on GMLSG 
I thought immediately of 1-14-67 and sure enough that's what it was, 
but just the tail end of the song. After checking the Viola Lee turned 
out to also be from 1-14-67, but just from the beginning up to the quick 
dropout in that song at the 4 minute 10 second mark. I have not really 
tried to figure out where the Midnight Hour comes from, but I suspect 
it will be duplication of something common. I was fooled into thinking 
the Viola Lee was an unique instrumental version because it didn't 
have the end of the song which is the only place they sung the lyrics on 
1-14-67. I hope this helps to clarify things for you if you come across 
this item. Think quickly -where else is there a 13 minute 17 second 
Midnight Hour? Teddy GoodBear: After listening to the rap in 
GMLSG, I'd say it's Lloyd with help from Pigpen. I've not heard 
Lloyd other than this recording, nor do I know what Lloyd's voice 
sounds like; as I'm just guessing. So I'm listing this entry as "sounding 
like Lloyd", unless somebody knows differently.

Bart Wise: This show is an audience tape, not a soundboard. The 
break between Viola Lee Blues and Cold Rain and Snow sounds like a 
master tape pause, and nearby audience clapping is obvious between 
the songs. The vocals and organ are prominent in the mix and the 
guitar and drums are echoey and distant; this may indicate that the 
taper stood near a PA stack and a bit distant from the stage, thereby 
reducing the prominence in the mix of instruments which received less 
PA sound reinforcement. All instruments are audible and there is very 
little hiss. There is some distortion on loud vocal and organ passages. 
Morning Dew cuts in on the first note of the song, so probably only 
one or two seconds is missing. New Potato Caboose fades out to about 
2 seconds of silence before Viola Lee Blues fades in; these are clearly 
cuts that occurred sometime after the master was made. About the date 
of this tape: my memory may not be exactly right, but I think this tape 
usually circulated as 1/28/67 until sometime in the 80's, when 
Deadbase started listing it as 1/27/67, at which point you started seeing 
it traded under that date. Under any circumstances, it has always 
seemed a little odd to me, a little too mature sounding and stretched out 
for my picture of what they were playing in the very beginning of 67. 
Despite the fact that there are too few tapes from that era to really 
make any conclusions about date from content, I decided to compare 
with other tapes with slightly more solid dates. First, I think this is 
probably all from one show, rather than a compilation as Jim Powell 
suggested. The whole tape has the same sound and the same mix of 
instruments, and from my own experience audience taping, even with 
the same rig in the same hall it would be unusual to get such similar 
sounding recordings on different nights. The chief point of inquiry 
was the version of Alligator. On 1/27/67, there is a 
drum intro and after the initial vocal section, the band proceeds straight 
into jamming without the intervening drum solo. After a few minutes 
of jamming, Garcia sings his "Alligator runnin' round my door" bit, 
which is followed by more jamming. Comparing this with other 
versions, we find that on 5/5/67 (a shaky date itself), 8/4/67, and 
9/15/67, Alligator is begun not with a drum intro but rather with a 
Garcia guitar intro. In all three versions, the band jumps into jamming 
after the vocals without a drum solo, and in all three versions Garcia 
does NOT sing "Alligator runnin' round..." 11/10/67 and 11/11/67, on 
the other hand, both start with a drum intro rather than the guitar intro. 
There is the signature drum solo after the initial vocals, and Garcia 
sings "Alligator runnin' round..." on both. If I had to date the tape of 
1/27/67 just on the basis of the above information, I would place it 
sometime in between 9/15/67 and 11/10/67. The three summer 67 
Alligators are consistent with each other and different from both the 
"1/27/67" and 11/67 shows. As for the Viola Lee Blues, at over 21 
minutes it certainly seems different from versions on 11/29/66 (about 
10 min), 8/4/67 (about 12 min), 9/15/67 (about 10 min, but cut), and 
even 11/10/67 (about 15 min, but cut.) Who could know, but it seems 
like it probably belongs later in the year. "1/27/67" may be the right 
date, but it might also be a case of the taper later saying "I think this 
was recorded at the Avalon in early 67." Perhaps we should note 
something like "The date is slightly questionable; tape content suggests 
later in the year." Tim Anderson: I've always been of the opinion that 
the drum solo in Alligator didn't start until Mickey joined up. Needless 
to say, I have no evidence to back this up. Just a gut feeling, and the 
mythology of the alleged two-hour Alligator on his first show, seems 
to point in that direction. David Sorochty: This tape sounds like an 
old audience tape, but with next to no audience noise. I believe this 
may be an audience tape that was recorded with the mics up high 
enough to eliminate crowd noise. That would be unusual for a tape this 
old. Immediately after they finish Cold Rain And Snow you can hear a 
Schoolgirl tease for about two seconds before the tape cuts off. I 
believe that DeadBase's comment that Alligator is uncertain does not 
mean that they are in doubt about its existence in this show, rather they 
mean that the general consensus is that Alligator was not played until 
later in that year, so Alligator throws doubt on the dating of this tape to 
January 1967. Jim Powell: Set 1: [78:17] Morning Dew [7:10] % 
New Potato Caboose [8:40#] % Viola Lee Blues [21:47] % Cold Rain 
And Snow [2:56] % drums [0:04] > Alligator [17:42] > Caution (Do 
Not Stop on Tracks) [19:50] % Most circulating copies of this tape 
require speed correction. This tape sounds like it was made with mics 
set up on the stage lip. The clapping (e.g. at the end of CRS) proves the 
tape was made with AUD mics. The minimal amount of audience 
noise proves the mics were placed way up front. The mix on the tape is 
the result of the mics' placement in relation to the various monitors on 
stage, plus the acoustic sound of the drums, plus the spillover from the 
PA stacks. Plainly these six tunes belong to the same show but it is not 
clear from the tape whether they belong to one set or two. New Potato 
Caboose fades down at the end, probably close to its conclusion. 
DeadBase lists a Good Morning Little Schoolgirl following Caution 
but the tape of Schoolgirl [17:42] circulating mislabeled "1/27/67" with 
this date is actually from 4/9/70. This tape used to circulate labeled 
"1/28/67" until DeadBase labeled the list "1/27/67," noting that it 
might actually belong to 1/28 or 1/29. Pigpen is of course the vocalist 
on Alligator. The performances on this tape are so incendiary that it's 
hard to believe it comes from so early in the year, but it certainly 
comes from before Sept. 67, since the inimitable Mr. Billy The K is the 
one and only sole drummer on the tape. And actually, after listening 
again to 11/19/66, the strongest performance of 1966 circulating, I find 
it much easier to believe that the 1/27/67 tape could actually be dated 
properly. I suggested that this tape was a "composite" because I 
remembered suspecting the Schoolgirl, and when I checked it just now, 
it was obvious that the Schoolgirl is an entirely different mix, even 
before I identified it as being in fact 4/9/70. On the 4/9/70 Schoolgirl 
Pigpen tries to start the vocals 8 bars early, but quickly cuts himself 
short --this is its easiest identifying mark. This tape of Fillmore West, 
San Francisco, California 4/9/70 also circulates with some bizarre 
chick wailing overdubbed in one channel, mislabeled "Fillmore East 
7/10/70." Does anyone have a copy of the Avalon 1/27/67 tape with a

version of Schoolgirl that seems to actually belong to 1/27/67? After 
listening again to this tape I am inclined even more strongly to 
nominate it as the strongest performance of 1967 circulating. (Truth to 
tell, there isn't a lot of competition, however.) David Scott Allan: 
New Potato is the exact same on both 1/27/67 and 10/22/67. Dew 
might be the same, too, but I'd have to go back and check. I still 
suspect that 1/27 may in fact be a falsely dated composite of shows 
from later in the year, especially given the well developed Alligator > 
Caution. I don't know if we'll ever have a definitive answer regarding 
the source(s) for that tape, but it's probably worth noting that the date is 
uncertain for more than just the Alligator > Caution. David Sorochty:I 
saw the posts on these shows and was kind of surprised, especially 
about 10/22 and 1/27. I say that since 10/22 is CD type quality 
soundboard and 1/27 is a grungy echoey aud tape, they don't sound 
anything alike. Maybe they are two different sources for the same 
show? DeadBase X has this to add: "This tape, which is of uncertain 
origin, also exists dated as 1/24/67, 1/28/67 and part of 2/12/67. Keep 
in mind that some sources claim Alligator was not performed until 
June."

4/8/67 KPIX-TV Studios, San Francisco, California 
Set 1: Cream Puff War [4#:36] 
Comments: Walkin' Blues may not be from same event. Other 
artist(s): The Wildflower and QMS. Bart Wise: (The cut in Cream 
Puff War is a VERY minor dropout and occurs in the first couple of 
seconds of the song.) Now I am no longer sure whether "Walkin' 
Blues" should be included in the database. It is clearly a faked-up piece 
where someone has spliced segments of Quicksilver playing the song 
together with segments of the Grateful Dead playing the song: Jim 
Murray singing, Cipollina playing Pigpen singing, Garcia playing Jim 
Murray singing, Cipollina guitar solo, Pigpen harp solo, Garcia guitar 
solo Quicksilver finish the song. The cuts are carefully done, and this 

might be how KPIX-TV broadcast the piece. The sound quality is 
similar to the version of Cream Puff War. I couldn't find the other 
version of Grateful Dead doing "Walkin' Blues" (from 1966) to 
compare with this one, if I even have it. Finally, if it helps with dating 
the tape, the Quicksilver web site lists October 1967 as the month Jim 
Murray left the band. David Sorochty: There is an interview already 
in progress that the tape cuts in on. Jerry is talking about Cream Puff 
War and says that it is the only song for which he has completely 
written the whole thing himself. There is some indecipherable talk 
about "the words", so maybe he means that he only wrote all the lyrics 
himself. Phil pipes up and is heard briefly and others are heard giggling 
in the background. The interview lasts only 24 seconds and then they 
go to play the song. The Cream Puff War that follows is 3 minutes and 
44 seconds long. Yeah -I know what you're thinking. There are some 
stories about them going on the Maze show and lip synching a song. 
I've even seen a picture from that TV appearance where Phil I believe, 
was holding a broom instead of his bass to mock out the whole lip 
synch thing. So I thought that even though this didn't sound like the 
version on the 1st album at all, it would be worth a check since if it is 
kind of grungy, and as it turns out this is a much longer version than 
the one on the LP and they *definitely* are not the same. So -if this 
was from that TV show, maybe they recorded the audio there for the 
TV show and they just lip synched it later? Is it possible that this is 
from another TV appearance where they didn't lip synch or maybe 
from a radio program? Who knows? I guess I always just presumed 
that when they lip synched on the Maze show it was to a song off the 
1st LP. David Sorochty continues: Walkin' Blues which I called 1966 
and we now are saying might be from 1967 "Maze TV" show. Well 
the version I call ??/??/66 on my web site is indeed the same version of 
this song which switches back and forth between the Dead and QMS. 
Here is what I have come up with: It starts out with QMS playing the 
song, at 27 seconds it switches to the Dead playing it, at 50 seconds it 
switches to QMS, at 1 minute and 27 seconds it switches to the Dead, 
at 1 minute and 59 seconds it switches QMS, who finish it out to a 
total time of 2 minutes and 14 seconds. If this is from a TV broadcast 
it would be really cool to see a video of this since the picture would 
have been switching back and forth in sync with the audio! Jim 
Powell: The interview cuts in on Garcia laughing with announcer 
talking about Ralph J. Gleason. Interview tape with Gleason following, 
who introduces Jerry & asks him "what kind of music does the 
Grateful Dead play. Jerry answers "loud," and continues by saying that 
they play "dance music." In response to a question about their sources 
Jerry says that they are "clever thieves." Later Jerry talks about playing 
feedback: "If you ignore it it just gets louder and louder." The 
interview concludes with Jerry introducing Cream Puff War and saying 
that he wrote it. Here's a listing of my copy of this tape, which is 
certainly lo gen though perhaps still not entirely complete (see below). 
The Maze TV Show, KPIX-TV, San Francisco, California 4/8/67. 
Total time [19:06 +]. The Wildflowers: "Crying In The Background" 
[3:40; title is a guess] Interviews with Ralph Gleason and with Garcia, 
Weir & Lesh [4:55]. This is the interview snippet where Jerry 
identifies the Dead as "clever thieves." Grateful Dead: Cream Puff War 

[3:51] The tape here contains a scrap of the announcer's voice left 
from a cut. Perhaps it's only commercials that were cut, together with 
the announcer's 'and now let's return ...'. See below, however. 
Quicksilver Messenger Service: Pride Of Man [3:42] Quicksilver 
Messenger Service: Walkin' Blues [2:23] Announcer: concluding 
remarks [fade down at 0:23] Somewhere I've seen or heard Ralph 
Gleason quoted during this period remarking that even when San 
Francisco, California bands perform the same song, they play it 
differently; he gives as his example the Dead's and Quicksilver's 
different handling of Robert Johnson's Walkin' Blues. During his 
concluding remarks the announcer seems to refer to this comment. 
Perhaps it appeared in a passage of the show cut between Cream Puff 
and Pride Of Man, or between Pride and Walkin' Blues. It seems less 
likely that the show also included a performance of the tune by the 
Dead.

Comments: Jerry and Phil as guest DJs at a radio station. There is no 
dead music, just some talking and joking around between the songs 
they play.

??/??/67 Whicker's World Video 
Comments: David Dieterich: The Golden Road complete and uncut. 5 
minutes in length, color, picture quality is fair, sound quality is good 
(say B+). The video portion is intense to watch. Strob lights are 
flashing and the camera zooms in and out very fast on the band 
members. It appears that Mickey was not there. There is a lot of 
footage of people dancing (and the guy doing the oil-based light show). 
Looks like a great party! Matt Schofield: There was a TV program 
called Whicker's World over here [UK] -starting sometime in the late 
60s I should think. Maybe also aired in the US. Can't remember it too 
well but I think it was the sort of program that could have had a 'look 
back at the SF 60s music scene in a patronising way' edition, but 
maybe I'm thinking of something else. Seems a simple enough way 
though for the words 'Whicker's World' to get attached to the video, 
rather than trying to discover a venue of that name. Tim Anderson: It 
was the studio version of GR overdubbed to the performance film. 
David Sorochty: Whicker's World 
Announcer #1: "...ow night. The retrospective exhibition of her work 
opens at the Opera Grovener Galleries in London next week." 
Announcer #2: 
"An assault on the senses, an LSD trip without drugs. Flashing strobe 
lights, spermatazoic color." The Golden Road which follows is just the 
version off the first album. I don't have the video, just the audio. 
Someone can give it another look and see if it is apparent they are lip 
synching. I cued up my CD of the 1st album and the Whicker's World 
tape and they sound the same to me, though the Whicker's tape is much 
more grungy of course. BTW both of the announcer's voices sound 
British. 
Recordings:: (5) Video.

4/29/67 Earl Warren Showgrounds, Santa Barbara, California 
Set 2: Viola Lee Blues 
Comments: Eyewitness (Dennis Donley) notes: "4/29/67 was my first 
Dead show. They played two sets that evening, with the Doors playing 
their set between the two. I do know, with absolute certainty that the 
Dead opened their second set with Viola Lee Blues. The first album 
had just come out a month or so before and I was mesmerized by that 
tune. After the Doors finished their set and left everyone fairly stunned, 
the Dead came back out almost immediately, and either Weir or Garcia 
said, 'How about a little Viola Lee Blues', whereupon I hopped on the 
bus for good." "You may be somewhat dubious of this information. I 

cannot tell you another song played by the Dead that evening. I can tell 
you that I am the source for the Deadbase notation for that show."

6/18/67 Monterey Pop Festival, Fairgrounds, Monterey, 
California 

Set 1: Cold Rain And Snow; Viola Lee Blues; Alligator > Caution (Do 
Not Stop on Tracks) 
Comments: Alligator > Caution may not be from Monterey. What 
makes me suspicious is that at the conclusion of Caution, Bill Graham 
is heard to say something like "let's hear it for the Grateful Dead." Bill 
Graham was not the emcee at the Monetery Pop Festival, so it's 
doubtful he would introduce the BAND from the stage. However, 
some folks have speculated that since Graham was in attendance and a 
friend of the Dead, he might have done the intro and or the outro as a 
"guest emcee." The Alligator is a curiosity; it's a very primordial 
version without vocals. Some parts are missing. Pigpen plays 
harmonica over the "verse" parts of the song. If indeed this date is 
accurate and Alligator was not yet fully fleshed-out as of mid-June '67, 
the certainly the true date of "5/5/67" falls somewhere later in the year.

7/31/67 O'Keefe Center, Toronto, Ontario, Canada 
Set 1: Good Morning Little Schoolgirl 
Comments: Bill Graham presents "The San Francisco, California

Apostles. One looking at the concert poster, (which can be see at): 
< http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Palms/2635/jcards/ja_4.jpg > 
can determine: There were shows from 31st July to 5th August 
according to the poster, ("evenings at 8.30, matinees on Wednesday 
and Saturday") which would mean a total of 8 shows [Mon. 7/31, Tues. 
8/1, Weds. 8/2 matinee, 8/2 evening, Thurs. 8/3, Fri. 8/4, Sat. 8/5 
matinee, 8/5 evening]. According to Adrian M. Johnson: the Dead 
played Good Morning Little Schoolgirl on 7/31/67. He backs this up 
with the following research: Contemporary Reviews The following 
articles from the Toronto Star were transcribed from microfilm, with 
personal commentary, by Malcolm O'Brien. August 1, Front page! 
Photo of woman in African print dress and shades dancing beside guy 
in kind of a mod outfit. [Caption: THIS IS THE O'KEEFE?] The 

normally staid O'Keefe Centre -a hotbed of Toronto culture -took on a 
mod look last night as young hippies danced in the aisles to the music 
of the Jefferson Airplane, a rock group in the San Francisco, California 
style. Later 300 youths danced on the stage as three groups jammed for 
50 minutes. Story, photo on page 19. from p.. 19.... "Kids dance in 
the O'Keefe's aisles" By VOLEMAR RICHTER Star staff writer 
Marty Balin smiled with delight as he looked over the 300 people 
dancing on the O'Keefe Centre stage last night. And just for fun he 
acted out the fear on Hugh Walker's face when the whole thing started. 
Balin's group, the Jefferson Airplane, rock 'n' roll exponents of the San 
Francisco hippie-freedom, got the kids dancing in the aisles in a joyous 
freewheeling happening. Ushers frantically tried to return them to their 
seats because, after all, other paying customers might want to see and 
besides that sort of thing just isn't done at the O'Keefe. "Disregard the 
ushers," the leader of one of the three rock groups on the bill shouted. 
Hundreds of them did and that's what bothered Walker, the Centre's 
managing director. Hasty Over at the side, he had a hasty discussion 
with Bill Graham, the San Francisco, California dance hall baron and 
producer of the show. Graham pointed out that the crowd was peaceful 
and happy and wouldn't think of tearing up those soft seats or anything 
else. "Let's just say it turned out all right," he said afterward, a few 
minutes before disappearing into a back room for more discussions 
with five grey-suited O'Keefe managers. Most of the near sellout 
crowd last night just watched. Dozens more sat out in the lobbies 
discussing the whole thing over a few more cigarettes. But maybe 300 
others danced to a pounding, driving, throbbing and oozing trip of 
sound and color supplied by three BANDs and two light shows. Here's 
how it happened. Appetizer Before the opening dim of the lights, the 
three screens on stage were already giving an appetizer. Centre screen 
carried the encircled, upside-down Y peace symbol, its colors slowly 
changing; green on blue, blue on two greens, tan on green and yellow. 
This screen was filled by Headlights, a group that adds the visual 
impact to the rock 'n' roll shows at Graham's Fillmore Auditorium, San 
Francisco, California in San Francisco, California. They work with 
liquid projections -colored oils swirled on a dish and projected -and 
rotating color wheels and loops of live-action film. At stage right and 
left were two extra screens carrying color projection by a New York 
group called Sensefex Inc. Their work involves the projection of paint-
splotch slides, electric motors that twirl the whole thing around. A 
movie projector showed its contents through a chute of angled mirrors 
that was also rotated by a motor. Hippies On the screens the multi-
hued splotches revolved slowly forming a kaleidoscope resembling 
some protoplasm. Its colors were hard and deeply defined; white 
Headlights projected soft, gentle colors like early morning. The 
audience was liberally sprinkled with hippies -in army shirts and 
commando hats, in beads and capes, and even in ties and jackets. First 
BAND: Toronto's Luke & the Apostles. started off with their hard 
blues-rock sound. Lead singer Luke (Gibson) hugged the microphone 
crooner-style as he belted out "My Soul." The peace symbol started 
dripping colors and eventually melting away shapelessly under the 
liquid colors that were applied above it. Bizarre globes turned green, 
red and back to green and ended like a red sky with stars. The 
Apostles. did two standard blues, "You Can't Judge A Book By 
Looking At The Cover" and "Good Morning Little Schoolgirl," both in 
a tough, heavy lumbering tone, filled with science-fiction and monster 
noises that were interesting to hear but out of place. "Schoolgirl" was 
also done by the next group, The Grateful Dead, but in a looser, freer 
version, and in the Chicago blues form it came from. It was symbolic 
of the free music the group plays. They take it easy and put in their 
improvisations naturally. That characterizes both the Jefferson 
Airplane and the Dead, the latter lesser known and less inventive. But 
the Dead are the true spokesmen for the San Francisco hippie scene 
and former resident musicians with the LSD Trips Festivals run by 
novelist Ken Kesey. (They also have an album that its Canadian 
distributor can't keep in stock, though the Dead have had no radio hits). 
Leader Jerry Garcia's group doesn't have as much substance as the 
Airplane, but they work together as precisely as parts of a machine. 
Two-hundred-pound Pig Pen (Ronald McKernan) gives a happy 
undertone to the music, while Phil Lesh plays complex bass. No effort

started. The taped sounds of a jet heralded their arrival. The group fills 
to stage front with Grace Slick's torchy vocal, "Somebody To Love." 
The Airplane captured that crowd without effort. The quality of their 
music, its intelligence and imagination superimposed on the necessary 
beat, drew them out to experience total involvement with sound and 
color. This music appeals to the older rock 'n' roll lovers. The young 
kids can't dance with the tempo transitions. The older ones do a free-
form, improvised dance Leader Balin, sings in a clear voice. Grace 
booms and lashes out with hers. Guitarist Jorma Kaukonen puts 
substance into the group's improvisations, while Jack Casady puts 
down a solid bass line. Spencer Dryden adds excitement with his 
drums, and Paul Kantner plays guitar, and sings. They project the 
spontaneity freshness of youth. Their music is alive, and 
communicates clearly despite its complex arrangements and structure. 
After the concert-dance, another dance occurs right on stage. This one 
planned as all three BANDs jam for a straight 50 minutes.

Lee Blues goes into a short Feedback and cuts off right near the very 
end, just as Jerry and then Pigpen start playing the Merry-Go-Round 
Broke Down (Looney Tunes) melody. A silly kind of ending to an 
intense song".

one of the most dramatic endings ever for this song. It finishes with 
Jerry's guitar cranking and screeching eeeeoowww!! It has a reverb

the stage. It was held in Lindley Meadow, which is near the polo field. 
We were stuck in traffic. I remember the motorcycle police writing 
down license numbers in their metal notepads. I didn't hear the 
Grateful Dead again until a couple of years later when I got their first 
album. The only part of that album I recognized was the part where 
Pigpen carries on about "a tiger in your tank" from Good Morning 
Little School Girl. I can't be sure that the wake is the first place I heard 
that, but it might have been."To see the concert art: <

Comments: Phil Lesh: "We were once accused of playing this song 
for 45 minutes -this version isn't quite that long, but it's the longest I 
could find. This was recorded at a Russian River resort ballroom on 
Sunday night of Labor Day Weekend -I don't think there were more 
than 25 people there, but we played our little hearts out for them 
anyway. Pig does his patented "Git your hands outta yo' pockets -git 
on up an' dance" rave, and the BAND keeps endlessly inventing new 
stuff behind him. We had to master this one in mono, because it was 
recorded with vocal mikes on one track and the whole BAND on the 
other." Quoted from 'Fallout From The Phil Zone'.

9/2?/67 Fillmore Auditorium, San Francisco, California 
Comments: Teddy GoodBear: The Wanger/Frost Documentry from 
released date of 6/8/69 has info on Mickey's 1st appearance in the 
Grateful Dead. Michael Wanger will provide a more accurate and 
detailed account of his documentry soon! For now this is what I came 
up with for this date: Mickey met the Dead or Billly K. the day before 
at the Fillmore or something like that. I have to go back and listen, 
since I don't. remember if Mickey said he met them while they were 
playing or just ran into them/Billy at the Fillmore the night before. I 
don't. see any Fillmore dates listed anywhere, just before the 29th. 
Most of this was done in late 1968, so their memory of events is fresh. 
They only have to remember back 1-3 years.

9/29/67 Straight Theater, San Francisco, California 
Comments: Other artist(s): Sons Of Champlin. Mickey Hart's first 
show. Billed as "Their first SF Dance in 6 months" on one poster and 
as "Straight Theater Dance Class" on another. DeadBase X incorrectly 
lists a tape which circulates as "5/5/67" as being from this night. 
Although the actual date of the tape in question is unknown, DeadLists 
provides information on it under the commonly associated date of 

5/5/67. Grateful Dead Family Album: "Denied a dance permit, the 
Straight Theater gigs were billed as 'dance classes' -admission was by 
registeration fee of $2.50." To see the concert art: < 
http://www.pompano.net/~goodbear/concert_art/09_29_67.html > 
Also the documentry mentions this show was billed as "dance classes". 
I'm not sure if Mickey said this meaning only the 29th or also the 30th 
as well. Adrian M. Johnson: The red and gold poster (which says 
"Their first SF Dance in 6 months") is the poster, by C. Braga. The 
black and white "big-mouth" artwork is in fact a handbill (artist 
unknown). The man and banner was used in a slightly different form 
on the cover of a CD bootleg. David Sorochty: I believe that this 
poster may go back to the 1800's. When I was in a fraternity years ago, 
we used to use this same image to make up flyers for parties we were 
having!

Brother And The Holding Company. From GDH: David Gans 
transcribed this setlist, but may not have made a complete copy of the 
vault tape (since it was often his practice to select from masters what 
he needed for his show only). David Sorochty: "The sound quality in 
Morning Dew starts out a bit grungy, but then clears up suddenly at 6 
min 14 sec into the song and remains near CD type quality for the rest 
of the tape. Maybe the first second or two of New Potato Caboose is 
clipped. Before Turn On Your Lovelight Jerry says 'sing you a little 
song' to which Phil replies 'thank you Jerry!'. Unfortunately Lovelight 
cuts off just as it was getting into a pretty heavy jam. Before Beat It On 
Down The Line'uh-hum' is said jokingly several times by several band 
members and then Bobby says 'good PA'. Jerry says 'twelve' and they 
begin Beat It On Down The Line (with twelve beats of course). The 
vocals to The Other One on this tape are the earliest known and go like 
this: When I woke up this morning, my head was not intact. I asked

my friends about it, try to find out where it's at. A wind came up inside 
of me, blew the dust clouds all away. The heat came 'round and busted 
me for smiling on a cloudy day. Comin', comin', comin' around... etc. 
Well the heat down in jail, they weren't very smart. They taught me 
how to read and write, they taught me the precious art. Of breakin' out 
of jail, well I learned that right away. And they didn't need me to 
telling them 'bout smiling first then running away! Comin', comin', 
comin' around... etc. 'thank you' Phil" David Scott Allan: "Another 
note about identical song versions appearing on multiple tapes: New 
Potato is the exact same on both 1/27/67 and 10/22/67. Dew might be 
the same, too, but I'd have to go back and check. I still suspect that 
1/27 may in fact be a falsely dated composite of shows from later in 
the year, especially given the well-developed Alligator->Caution." To

Comments: "Amazing Electric Wonders" -Other artist(s): Buffalo 
Springfield; Blue Cheer. Jeff Tiedrich: "There's a bit of a mystery 
here. The Alligator>Caution that appears on both the 11/10/67 and 
11/11/67 tapes are identical --even on the vault reels! It is unknown 
which of the two dates these songs belong to, but it's not unreasonable 
to presume that 11/10 is the original and 11/11 is the copy. The best 
explanation (read: speculation) is that someone copied the 11/10/67 
Alligator>Caution onto the end of the 11/11/67 reels. The master reels 
for these two shows were not originally in the Dead's vault --they were 
stored at Warner Brothers, which is presumably where all this 
mysterious copying took place." Jim Powell: "The introduction 
preceding Schoolgirl features Jerry suggesting people use the time 
between songs to order a pizza, take off their clothes, get high, hoot 
and jeer at the performers." David Sorochty: "There is another 
Cryptical-->Other One--->Cryptical sequence on the Shrine '67 tapes 
currently listed as being from the 11/10/67 show, which definitely is 
not duplication of the other one (i.e. the 11/11/67 version). The two 
versions have slightly different lyrics. It is not duplication of any other 
version in circulation. Maybe they did play it both nights. If more 
information comes to light about this sequence and its correct date, 
then its status may change. This is another mystery about these tapes. 
These are the lyrics of the version identified as from 11/10/67: '...two, 
three, four' Cryptical Envelopment > That's It For The Other One I 
woke up this morning, my head was not in sight. I would ask the walls 
about it, but they vanished overnight. I could not think or spell my 
name, or fly their words away. The heat came round and busted me for 
smiling on a cloudy day. Comin', comin', comin' around... etc. 
Escapin' through the lilly fields, when I came across an empty space. 
It quivered and exploded, left a bus stop in its place. Well a bus came 
by and I got on, that's when it all began. There was Cowboy Neal, at 
the wheel, of a bus to never-ever land. Comin', comin', comin' 
around... etc. Cryptical Envelopment Jerry: 'thank you' David 
Sorochty and Teddy GoodBear: These shows originally circulated 
together out of order on two cassettes labeled as '11-8,9-67' and as '1110,11-
67', however they only played two dates -the 10th and the 11th. 
Some tapes have the studio versions of Born Cross-Eyed and Dark Star 
which we list under 11-14-67 (see below) and others do not. When the 
studio songs are there, they are at the beginning of the side which 
continues with It Hurts Me Too from 11-10-67. To confuse things, 
some of the tapes in circulation have sides A and B reversed compared 
to others. Both copies of Feedback usually are cut off by the end of the 
tape sides, although our timings listed come from copy which does not 
get cut. Other songs also can get cut on one person's tape and not on 
another's. Beat It On Down The Line is not on these cassettes, but 
reportedly is on other tapes of these shows. It's apparent that there are 
several different transfers from reels to cassettes in circulation. They 
are very confusing to say the least. The first tape usually came labeled 
as '11/8&9/67'. **Before start Alligator: Brief guitar feedback or 
whistle, Pigpen says something?, brief Alligator tuning before start and 
Pigpen says what sounds like "3" or "hey" at the start. They are 
different, (slightly). It's very possible that both versions are the same 
on my tapes, since the cut in the middle is about the same timing minus 
the different tunings before the start. The two copies of Alligator > 
Drums >Caution > Feedback on these tapes apparently are the same 
performance, and we don't know which date it's really from. Usually it 
gets cut off by the end of the tape side (at a different spot in each 
copy). It is listed under 11/10/67 for now, but if more information 
comes to light, then its status may change."

Set 1: That's It For The Other One [#1:27] > Cryptical Envelopment 
[3:28]; Death Don't Have No Mercy [5:28]; Born Cross-Eyed [2:39] 
Comments: This tape circulates as "Anthem Of The Sun studio outtakes 
1967/68". All are instrumentals except Born Cross-Eyed. The 
version of Born Cross-Eyed is the same version from the filler on tapes 
of the 11/10,11/67 Shrine shows which is labeled as 11/14/67 (see 
above). 
Recordings:: (15) SB. From a unknown generation source.

Feedback [0:55] % Feedback [7:39] > And We Bid You Goodnight 
[0:21#] 
Comments: This circulates mislabeled as "10/31/67 Winterland, San 
Francisco, California -Trip Or Freak". Cryptical cuts in at the very end 
just as they are about to begin the "and when the day had ended" part. 
You can hear vocals clearly only a few times on this tape. During The 
Other One the vocals are virtually impossible to hear, but they are there 
in a few places. Jerry comes back in at the 2:00 mark in drums, but its 
not till 3:18 that everyone else jumps back into Alligator again.

??/??/67 school yard of the little private school, Canyon, 

California 
Comments: Bill Gallagher: In the book "Berkeley At War" by WJ 
Rorabaugh (1989), p. 145 it says "In 1967 Canyon's hippies held a 
benefit concert to raise money to rebuild their general store. Country 
Joe McDonald, the Grateful Dead and others came to play. The 
narrow, winding road into Canyon was clogged with flower-painted 
VW vans." Canyon is a small community over the hill from Berkeley 
towards Moraga and Walnut Creek. Bill Gallagher contacted Country 
Joe and he said: "The benefit was held in Canyon, I believe, in the 
school yard of the little private school. I have a couple of posters of 
the event. cheers, cjm"

Comments: show billed as "Mickey and the Heartbeats". Bobby and 
Pigpen were absent. (1) starts very much like the post-drums portion of 
Alligator, and contains a brief, Spanish Jam-like theme. It also 
contains major hints of Caution (Do Not Stop On Tracks). (2) cut here 
is likely quite small. (3) with Paul Butterfield on harmonica. (4) very 
similar to New Potato Caboose. My copy cuts at 16:28, but there is 
clearly more.

??/??/69 unknown venue and location 
Set 1: Dark Star [20:01#] 
Comments: These tapes have been in circulation since the 70s. The 
longer tape begins with the Dark Star and cuts just as they are starting 
the transition bridge out of Dark Star; copies in circulation are quite 
degraded SBD and sometimes circulate labeled AUD. The shorter 
fragment contains the last 12:54 of the Dark Star and is rather less 
degraded than the other tape, but still considerably. T.C.'s keys insure 
the '69 date. The 1st vocals start at 6:44 and finish at 7:43, and they 
never really go into space afterward, marking this Dark Star as early 
summer 69 at the latest. Riffs resembling Sputnik occur around 12:20. 
2nd vocals start at 18:34 and conclude at 19:29. The longer tape breaks 
off 0:09 after the conclusion of the 2nd vocals; the shorter fragment 
continues for another 0:22 to the end of the transition bridge, and then 
cuts. Probably this tape is to be dated to the first four months of 69 but 
conceivably it could be as late as July. Latvala was unable to identify 
it. My best wild guess is Winterland, San Francisco, California 5/3/69.

Comments: Total time [1:50:13]. The first verse of Dupree and the 
first verse of Rag are clipped on the circulating tape, and there is some 
Jamming cut near the end of The Eleven. Jerry plays acoustic guitar 
during Dupree's and Mountains, switching to electric about 1:10 into 
the Jam before Dark Star. It seems probable there was an encore.

Comments: Total time [1:59:32]. The old circulating tape of the 1st 
set begins with Graham's introduction; the newly circulating tape of 
both sets is missing this intro and cuts in on Schoolgirl 14 seconds after 
the beginning of the song. There is a cut in The Eleven at 11:05 on the 
circulating SBD, probably due to the end of a reel or cassette side. The 
Eleven analyzes Saint Stephen > 1st vocals 1:08 > transition Jam 2:06

Comments: Total time [2:31:20]. The circulating 45-minute cassette 
side version of the first set has several minutes of Turn On Your 
Lovelight cut to fit the side; the complete first set requires a 50 minute 
side. On the circulating tape Saint Stephen cuts during its Jam at 4:08 
and the tape resumes 
during vocals at "...Wonder who will water all the children" --i.e. the 
tape in circulation is missing a couple minutes here.

Comments: Total time [2:13:36]. Jerry plays acoustic guitar during 
Dupree's and Mountains, switching to electric just short of 2 minutes 
into the following Jam. There is a cut, probably brief, on the circulating 
tape, 5:30 into the Cryptical reprise. In the pause after It's A Sin Jerry 
asks the audience "What do you want to hear that lasts 10 minutes" -obviously 
he'd just been told by the Family Dog's stage manager that 
they had 10 minutes left on the set. The following sequence beginning 
with Alligator runs 19:56, mostly on the strength of a monumental 
passage of Feedback. Perhaps this has a bearing on the stage manager's 
draconian behavior the following night during Viola Lee. (1) 1st vocals

has cuts, both brief, during Cryptical reprise at 6:20 and 7:09. At 10:48 
into the Viola Lee Blues the Dead's instruments lose power, Bobby 
says "it seems someone is trying to tell us something" and they finish 
the tune with a chorus of vocals only.

Comments: Obviously the 1st set list is incomplete; probably 
Cryptical Envelopment > Drums > preceded The Other One but 
possibly something else. Likely more tunes are missing before that, too 
--if the tape catalogued under SET 1 represents the second side of a 
cassette master, then there's 45 minutes missing previous to where the 
tape cuts in. According to the review of the show by Richard Saltus in 
the Arizona Daily Star for 4/12/69, they also performed versions of 
Morning Dew and Sittin' On Top Of The World. Presumably these 
tunes belong before That's It. There is a Main Ten Jam in Dark Star, 
starting at 9:53 and running till 11:05, a total of 1:12; this is the first 
known occurence of this kernel and prototype of Playin In The Band. 
There is a cut in Saint Stephen at 3:26; probably a couple minutes are 
lost here. There is a cut in The Eleven at 3:56, with a passage of 
Jamming of uncertain length lost (perhaps as little as 20 seconds but 
also possibly as long as several minutes). For a copy of the review see

if you can think of aNew Yorkthing weird enough for us to do, we'd be 
more than delighted to do it --perhaps; perhaps." There is a cut in The 
Other One at 1:39, apparently a flip chop on the master cassette; 
probably 4 to 9 minutes of Jamming are lost here. Jerry plays acoustic 
guitar during Dupree's and 
Mountains, shifting to electric at 1:46 during the Jam after Mountains.

Encore: [13:49] Dead Air [3:24]; Not Fade Away Tease [1:12]; [0:54] 
It's All Over Now, Baby Blue [7:39]; [0:40] 
Comments: Total time [2:50:09]. There are probably several minutes 
of music missing in the tape break in the first set. This cut comes early 
to be a reel flip; if it is on the master there must have been some 
mishap with the taping. Jerry plays slide on Hard To Handle. The 
Eleven does not include the William Tell opening passage; it begins 
with the Jam in 11s. The second Jam In 8s includes quotations of 
Mountain Jam and of the instrumental bridge out of GDTRFB 
(resembling Bid You Goodnight). There are brief cuts in the SBD at 

0:31into the 2nd Jam In 8s and again at 1:48. The first of these cuts 
comes about 45 minutes into the set and probably represents a reel flip. 
There is a cut in Caution (Do Not Stop On Tracks) at 8:01; some 
vocals are lost here and the tag end of the vocals seems to fade down, 
making this resemble an edit and raising the question of what's on the 
vault copy. Caution (Do Not Stop On Tracks) breaks off at 12:52; at 
least 30-60 seconds of Jamming and transition to Feedback must be 
lost here, plus some of Feedback. The encore is preceded by 3:24 of 
the audience chanting "more more more." Bobby stops the NFA tease 
with "We're gonna take a minute here and tune up." Jerry concludes the 
show with: "Thanks alot. We'll see you the next time the band is in 
town. You've been good people." (1) Jam in 8s

Before Bill Graham's intro ("San Francisco, California's own Seven 
Samurai, the Grateful Dead") a group of deadheads can be heard 
singing off mic: "Come all ye faithful / Joyful and triumphant, / Come 
ye, O come ye / To Wi-in-ter-land." DeadBase IX gives this list for the

Set 1: Morning Dew; Cryptical Envelopment > The Other One > 
Good Morning Little Schoolgirl 
Comments: This obviously incomplete list has recently emerged:. 
DeadBase IX notes "Santana and his Grandmasters sat in on an 
extended drum set." Note the similarity of this list to 5/29/69, and the 
extended percussion session with additional drummers there.

Comments: There is at least one additional drummer (a conga player) 
involved in the prolonged percussion Jam following Alligator, and 
probably several --sometimes said to be Santana's rhythm section. At 
the beginning of the Drums someone probably not Jerry is playing 
guitar percussion (i.e. clicking a pick across damped strings). The 
"Jams" interspersed are Jerry Jamming with this percussion ensemble. 
There is also an unidentified additional vocalist audible twice during 
Turn On Your Lovelight. It is possible this tape is actually from 
5/11/69; see Comments: under that date.

The tapes cut in on the beginning of China Cat; the first 20-30 seconds 
are missing here. On the circulating tape the Dark Star cuts off during 
the final transition into Saint Stephen. Older circulating copies of the 
second set portion of this tape break off about 8 mintues into Dark 
Star; more recently copies containing the complete Dark Star have 
come into circulation. This older, still more clipped 2nd set portion of 
the tape sometimes used to circulate mislabeled "Family Dog 8/29/69" 
and the Family Dog 8/30/69 tape sometimes used to circulate 
mislabeled "Fillmore West, San Francisco, California 6/5/69."

Comments: Rob Eaton supplied the first set list given here; for the 
second set he provided the following list, noting that Turn On Your 
Lovelight through Who's Lovin You were with Wayne Ceballos, 
vocals and harmonica: However, The Things I Used To Do and Who's 
Lovin You Tonight are Elvin Bishop's tunes, not Ceballos's, and 
according to Vern White Ceballos says that Bishop was not present the 
night he sat in with the Dead, apparently 6/8/69. Perhaps this list 
belongs to the day of this run when Bishop did sit in, 6/6/69. Vern 
White goes on to say: "Wayne Ceballos may have "guested" on another 
show with the Dead. This is mentioned in the Bill Graham 
autobiography (page 202) in an interview passage with Jerry. Ceballos 
sat in *for* Jerry because he hadn't arrived on time for the show. 
Wayne recalls that it was Phil who called him up to the stage and 
remembers playing (to quote) "that song about the cold rain", amongst 
others. "Cold Rain & Snow" isn't included on the DeadBase list for 
6/8/69 so it's possible that it's another date." It seems equally possible 
that, however, that our lists for 6/8/69 are incomplete or incorrect. 
Clearly we need better information for this date and for 6/6/69 as well.

Set 1: Green Green Grass Of Home % El Paso % Cryptical

Casey Jones % Morning Dew 
Comments: There were Early and Late shows. A review by Peter 
Goddard in the Toronto Telegram for Wed. July 9, 1969 refers to 
performances of Casey Jones and Morning Dew. These tunes were 
probably from the Early Show. In the Toronto Star Jack Batten notes 
that the early show opened with two country tunes, the rest of the set 
consisting of a variety of blues, more country, and "numbers 
reminiscent of San Francisco, California's early rock days." Bob 
Langmaid thinks these may have included Mountains of the Moon and 
Doin' That Rag, and probably Saint Stephen. According 
to Malcolm O'Brien, who attended the early show, the two opening 
country tunes were Green Grass and El Paso, with Garcia on pedal 
steel for both. He also distinctly remember That's It For The Other One 
and thinks they may also have played New Potato Caboose. David 
Galbraith, another audience member, confirms Green Grass, The Other 
One, and Morning Dew.

[9:00#] 
Comments: The soundboard cassette tape in circulation is rather 
degraded. It breaks off during High Time at the end of Side A; Side B 
cuts in during Drums and breaks off during Turn On Your Lovelight. 
The audience tape in circulation runs from Alligator into The Other 
One before breaking off. Some copies of the AUD run 30:46, breaking 
off 5:49 into The Other One; others break off 0:52 earlier. Probably 
more of this show exists on the AUD master, but only this portion 
seems to circulate. Timings given here represent a composite of the 
SBD and AUD. "People of New York! We space invaders greet you," 
says Jerry at the beginning of this show. "Now folks we understand 
from the management of this little establishment that if you want to, 
you can dance. And I'll tell you where we're at behind it, it's really nice 
to play when people are dancing." Garcia plays pedal steel guitar on 
Hard To Handle and Silver Threads. At the end of Mama Tried they try 
to go directly into High Time and then break off --"Gotta tune up: the 
weather is awful for tuning" says Jerry. The drummers chant is barely 
audible on the SBD and inaudible on the AUD (there were no vocals 
mics for the drummers; it must be the drum mics picking it up on the 
SBD). The Jam between Alligator and The Other One includes

Comments: The circulating tape of Green Grass, Ol' Slewfoot and 
Mountains is from an audience master. The Doin that Rag through 
High Time sequence often circulates labeled "AUD" but is probably 
SBD with very bad levels. The Dark Star through Turn On Your 
Lovelight sequence is soundboard. The Minglewood circulating 
mislabeled "7/12/69" is not from this show. Jerry plays pedal steel 
guitar on Ol' Slewfoot and Green Grass, and acoustic guitar on 
Mountains. Turn On Your Lovelight features several anonymous guest 
vocalists and an attempt to make Mickey sing, and includes Pigpen's 
assertion that "There ain't nothin' dirty --it's all fun." There is a 
cassette flip in Turn On Your Lovelight at 9:23.

8/16/69 Woodstock, Max Yasgur's Farm, Bethel, New York 
Set 1: 1:16:56] Intro [0:54]; Saint Stephen [1:#59] > Mama Tried 

[2:37] > High Time (1) [0:23]; [10:29]; Dark Star [18:04] > High Time 
[5:31] % [0:03]; Turn On Your Lovelight [35:51]; [1:13#] 
Comments: Generally only the first 45 minutes of this set circulate -omitting 
the Turn On Your Lovelight (and who IS that dosed freak 
raving about the "third coast"). There is a cut in Stephen on all 
circulating copies at about 1:25; most of the song is missing. After 
Mama Tried they segue into High Time but break off after 0:23 with 
Jerry saying, in a incredulous psychedelicized voice, "You want it 
*louder*?" Afterward there is an extensive pause for technical 
difficulties and stoned confusion. There is also a partial video of this 
set in circulation and boy do they looked loaded --only Billy is still 
capable of keeping his cool. (1) false start

the same song performed on 11/8/70 (and not, as sometimes reported, 
The Battle Of New Orleans).

Comments: The circulating tape, which times [40:08] total in the least

starts well before the end of Side A.The circulating fragment of Dark 
Star cuts in during space, moves into a Jam on [5:31] and reaches 
second vocals at [16:10] . There are also copies in circulation which 
cut in about 3 minutes later in Dark Star and copies which cut off short 
of High Time. Some copies of this tape used to circulate mislabeled 
"Fillmore West, San Francisco, California 6/5/69" and some partial 
copies of Fillmore West 6/5/69 2nd set used to circulate mislabeled 
"Family Dog 8/29/69."

Comments: This circulates labeled "Unknown Venue 9/11/69." The 
Family Dog at the Great Highway seems far the likeliest venue. This is 
an early version of the tune, and the arrangement is somewhat 
different. Probably it's Jorma playing slide guitar.

the tape concludes with a string of tunings, including Take Me Out To 
The Ballgame and a tease of The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down 
Tuning. DeadBase IX lists an "Uncle John's Jam" preceding the 
tunings but this does not appear on the tape in circulation. For the Late 
Show DeadBase IX lists Mama Tried; Good Morning Little Schoolgirl. 
This tape is a pretty good job of audience taping, especially for this 
venue.

The Other One was preceded by Cryptical > Drums. The Jam between 
Cryptical and Cosmic takes the opening riff of Cosmic Charlie & 
blends it with the rhythms of the Jam out of Cryptical. DeadBase IX 
lists a Hard To Handle before China Cat and, after Cosmic Charlie, 
Mama Tried; Good Lovin. This is an excellent job of audience taping.

10/25/69 Winterland, San Francisco, California 
Set 1: [29:19] Dead Air [0:10]; Dark Star [21:42] > Saint Stephen 

[6:00] > The Eleven [1:27#] 
Comments: The 1st gen cassette that brought this fragment of tape 
into circulation was made shortly after the show for a Dead roadie. On 
one side it has six tunes from the Airplane's set (Somebody To Love 
through Uncle Sam's Blues) and on the other from the Dead's set 
originally had the 45 minutes starting with Dark Star. Early in the 
cassette's history, however, another signal was recorded over the 
second half of the Dead side of the tape, cutting in early in The Eleven 
and leaving just the first 29:19 from this segment of the show on the 
circulating cassette. Apparently there are five 7-inch soundboard reels 
from the show in the vault (including at least some of the other bands 
on the bill). The snippet of Good Lovin' sometimes appended to the 
circulating tape of 10/25/69 does not belong to this date. Dark Star is 
preceded by a count off and a 1-note false start from Phil, followed by 
a second count off. The Dark Star features the earliest known "Feelin 
Groovy" Jam or "Bridge" Jam. According to DeadBase IX before Dark 
Star they played Good Lovin; Me And My Uncle; China Cat 
Sunflower > I Know You Rider; Casey Jones; High Time, and after 
The Eleven they concluded with Turn On Your Lovelight. If this list is 
accurate it may be two sets, probably with the break after Casey Jones. 
Jefferson Airplane and Sons of Champlin were also on the bill. Sons of 
Champlin probably opened. If these are two sets then it may mean that 
the Dead and the Airplane played two sets each, taking turns. 
DeadBase IX lists Hot Tuna as well, though they do not appear on the 
poster for the show.

Cryptical Envelopment [1:46] > Drums [4:56] > The Other One [9:54] 
> Turn On Your Lovelight [17:22#] 
Comments: The Star Spangled Banner is performed upon a 
pennywhistle --perpetrator unknown. The tape in circulation was 
edited, probably off 1st generation cassette copies of the master reels, 
possibly onto DAT. There are splices before and after Mama Tried, 
Next Time, and Good Lovin, and songs are probably missing in these 
gaps. According to DeadBase IX they played Hard To Handle and 
Casey Jones after Morning Dew; Me And My Uncle and Cold Rain & 
Snow after Mama Tried; and High Time after Next Time You See Me. 
It is impossible to tell from the circulating tape whether this show had 
one Dead set or two. If there were two sets probably Good Lovin' 
concluded the first. On the circulating tape the Uncle John's Jam breaks 
off, cutting back to Dark Star at 1:45; 20 seconds to 2 minutes of 
Jamming must be lost here. On the tape in circulation the Turn On 
Your Lovelight also cuts off before its conclusion, as they are 
beginning to wind it up; probably a couple minutes are missing here. 
There is also a bogus tape in circulation mislabeled "Fillmore 
Auditorium, San Francisco, California 11/7/69 II;" this is actually a 
degraded bad speed copy of 2/13/70 2nd set SBD.

Space [8:10] > Feedback [4:16] > And We Bid You Good Night 
[3:02]; [0:56#] 
Comments: Total time [2:43:23]. It is impossible to tell from the 
tapes in circulation whether this is two sets or one, but it seems long 
for one (notice also the 1st-set-concluding Cumberland on 12/11/69). 
The first bit of Good Morning Little Schoolgirl is clipped on the tape in 
circulation. According to DeadBase IX in Set 1 there is a I'm A King 
Bee before China Cat. The circulating soundboard tape of China Cat > 
Jam > Rider cuts off 0:20 into the Jam and resumes with only the last 
0:58of Rider (China Cat [3:00] > Jam [0:20#] % Rider [#0:58]). The 
circulating audience tape runs from the beginning of China Cat through 
the end of Rider, with 42 seconds missing starting 1:39 into China Cat 
(China Cat [2:#18] > Jam [3:03] > Rider [3:18]). This is a fairly crude 
AUD recording but it supplies the entire 5:03 passage of Jam > Rider 
missing on the SBD. The timings for China Cat > Rider given above 
represent a composite of the two tapes. There are no other signs of the 
rest of this AUD master in circulation. The tape of Dark Star through 
Uncle John's Band Jam in circulation labeled "AUD" is in fact a very 
degraded copy of the SBD. The Eleven analyzes: 1st vocals [1:13] > 
transition Jam [1:31] > Eleven Jam [5:02] > Eleven vocals [0:44] > 
Eleven Jam [3:09] > Eleven 2nd theme Jam [2:53] > transition Jam In 
8s [0:32] > Caution (Do Not Stop On Tracks) ... On the circulating tape 
the second part of Caution (Do Not Stop On Tracks) breaks off at 
16:22, as Pigpen is winding it down. This could be an hour-long reel 
running out. There must be from 40 seconds to 2 minutes or more of 
transitional Jamming missing here. When the recording resumes after 
this splice the band is playing a Jam in 4s. After 12 seconds of this 
someone recites: When ya goin truckin down the line, just past that 
neighbor, you're fine, give him that bright eye, a saaaaad smile, and 
know that we've all been walkin this same long mile. The voice is not a 
bandmember's. Hunter and Kesey have been suggested but it sounds 
like neither. The recitation is mildly mannered, and slightly suggestive 
of Dylan's phrasing in Clothesline Saga and other Basement Tapes. 
Following these verses the Dead almost immediately dissolve the Jam 
and transit into the Main Ten. The Jam in 4s shares thematic elements 
with the Main Ten. Perhaps these verses are a first attempt at 
finding words to go with the Main Ten. On the other hand, the 
recitation sounds improvised. The identity of the speaker is a mystery 
still to solve. (1) with recitation

Comments: Total time [1:26:14]. The 1st set SBD master is defective 
and is not widely circulated. Probably they stopped this set short to 
solve the technical problems that plague the whole of it. The second set 
intro goes "Once again and without interruption, the Grateful Dead." 
The 2nd set tape was among the first early Dead SBDs in circulation. 
Turn On Your Lovelight fades down incomplete on the circulating

Comments: The circulating SBD is degraded, the last of 3 sides 
severely degraded, and the master may well be defective. The 
introduction centers on discussion of the free concert scheduled for 
December 6. Originally the Dead were supposed to close this concert, 
headlined by the Rolling Stones, and including Santana, the Flying 
Burrito Brothers, Jefferson Airplane, and Crosby, Stills, Nash and 
Young. It was planned for Golden Gate Park, and the agreement was 
that the concert would be announced just a few days beforehand, to 
keep the park and city from being over-impacted. When Mick Jagger 
announced the concert early to the press, San Francisco, California 
Parks & Recreation backed out. As of 12/4 (as another announcement 
after Black Peter makes clear) concert planners thought they would be 
staging the show at Sears Point Raceway, but over the next 24 
hours the site would be shifted a third and final time, to Altamont 
Speedway.

Comments: During the pause after Me And My Uncle, referring to 
the free concert the next day at Altamont Bobby says "Bear wants me 
to tell you to bring dope" and Jerry adds "Not only that but it's 
something to do." This taper was rather fast on his pause button. He 
clips several songs and pauses three times during Drums. Otherwise, 
he made quite a decent audience tape for '69 Dead. Jerry introduces 
Dire Wolf saying "This is a song you can all sing along on" and as it

turned out "Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me" was a 
good refrain at Altamont. Jerry uses this intro the night before as well. 
The longest China Cat > Rider bridge Jam yet features a Caution (Do 
Not Stop On Tracks) tease from Phil among its divagations. The Uncle 
John's Jam is just a scrap from the song's Jam in 7s. Apparently the 
previous night was the song's premier (there are Uncle John's Jams on 
11/7 and 11/8) but as far as we know they didn't play the tune again till 
12/12. Given this taper's fast pause button finger, he's quite capable of 
having clipped the transition from Uncle John's Jam into the Main Ten, 
but unless he ran into serious trouble it's difficult to figure how he lost 
nearly the whole of Uncle John in a flip (he had a flip coming, 
probably, after Dire Wolf). The evidence leaves it totally unclear 
whether they 
played the tune or just the Jam.

[5:14]> Cosmic Charlie [0:51#] 
Comments: The FM-SBD broadcast tape from 12/10/69 is listed 
under SET 1. Stephen Stills plays guitar on Casey Jones, Schoolgirl 
and Morning Dew, and sings Black Queen. The circulating FM-SBD 
fades down during the Jam out of Black Queen. * The tapes of 
12/11/69 & 12/12/69 have been in circulation for at least 25 years. 
Often they used to be mislabeled "Kaleidoscope Theater, LA," but the 
Thelma Theater venue was established as the correct labeling more 
than a dozen years ago and probably there are few tapes left now 
labeled with the wrong venue. Parts of 12/11/69 still circulate 
mislabeled "12/10/69," though, and other misdatings among the three 
shows also occur. * There is a bogus tape that has been in circulation 
for at least 20 years, a 45-minute cassette side often labeled "Thelma 
Theater 12/10/69" but sometimes also "Thelma Theater 12/11/69," 
usually circulated in connection with other tapes from this run. It 
begins with a copy of the 12/11/69 Dark Star which cuts immediately 
after "transitive 
nightfall of diamonds" and splices into the tape of That's It For The 
Other One > Cosmic Charlie listed in SET 2. This turns out _not_ to be 
the 12/11/69 sequence, as previously assumed. T.C.'s keys make it '69, 
the long Drums date it to September or after, the expansive Jamming 
points to the end of the year, and the micing sounds like the other 
Thelma Theater tapes, so we might as well call it 12/10/69 until we 
learn better. On this tape, Cosmic Charlie breaks off after 23 seconds. 
There is a strong Cosmic Charlie tease at 2:19 into the Cryptical 
reprise. * Curiously, a substantial fragment of this That's It > Cosmic 
Charlie forms part of another of the oldest bogus tapes in circulation. 
This tape has been around since the mid-70s at least, and goes by many 
names, including "Haight St. 3/3/68 II", "Winterland, San Francisco, 
California 4/3/68" and "San Francisco, California 6/8/68." This 90minute 
cassette consists of an unknown venue 1970 Good Lovin, 
followed by the San Diego 1/10/70 China Cat > Rider, Cold Rain and 
Hard To Handle, followed by the Avalon 4/6/69 That's It For The 
Other One > Death Don't. Death Don't breaks off incomplete, splicing 
to the last 3:06 of the Drums of this tape of That's It > Cosmic Charlie 
(the same master) and cutting off after 51 seconds of Cosmic Charlie. 
This fragment times 21:01 total: Drums [#3:06] > The Other One 

[11:57]> Cryptical Envelopment [5:07] > Cosmic Charlie [0:51#]. 
There is a brief cut at 1:01 into The Other One; probably very little is 
lost here. In some versions of the tape Cosmic Charlie concludes the 
cassette; in others, the tape concludes 
with Satisfied With My Gal and The Rub from the 1964 Folk Fest 
(Garcia, Pigpen & Friends, acoustic). * For 12/10/69 DeadBase IX 
gives the following list (which should be regarded with extra 
skepticism): China Cat Sunflower > I Know You Rider; Black Peter; 
Me And My Uncle; Cold Rain & Snow; Mama Tried > High Time; 
Easy Wind; Dire Wolf; Casey Jones; Good Morning Little Schoolgirl; 
Morning Dew; Black Queen > Turn On Your Lovelight, noting that it 
is "incomplete between Dire Wolf and Casey Jones." We need a fresh 
report on the contents of the vault tape of this show.

Comments: Total time [3:12:11]. The 45-minute cassette side 
containing Casey Jones through I Know You Rider usually circulates 
separately from the other tapes for this date, often mislabeled 
"12/10/69," sometimes labeled "AUD." The SBDs for this run have an 
unusual amount of hall presence --audience noise, stage banter --and 
others sometimes circulate labeled "AUD" as well. The Eleven 
analyzes: 1st vocals [1:10] > transition Jam [4:16] > Eleven Jam [1:04# 

+#0:44] > Eleven vocals [0:43] > Eleven Jam [2:43] > Eleven 2nd 
theme Jam [1:28] > transition Jam In 8s [0:03] > Cumberland Blues ... 
As much as 2-3 minutes of Jamming is lost in the cut at 6:40 in The 
Eleven. Someone proposes 35 beats for BIODTL but Jerry claims he 
can't count past three. After further debate they settle on 21. The Good 
Lovin' Drums sound like they're starting to wind up when the tape 
breaks off. Several minutes of Jamming must be lost here. The 
concluding fragment of Good Lovin' appears to circulate only in very 
degraded form. The show seems to conclude with Cosmic Charlie. (1)

Comments: The circulating soundboard tape cuts at 1:26 into the Jam

High Time; the Rider is entirely missing from the tape but undoubtedly 
it was played. There is a cut about 10 minutes into Turn On Your 
Lovelight, with 40 seconds to several minutes lost. The performance of 
Turn On Your Lovelight breaks off at 21:12, as Pigpen is starting to 
wind things up, when power to the stage is cut and all the instruments 
go dead (but not the vocals mic). This is probably the promoters 
enforcing their curfew and ending the show --less than 5 minutes short 
of where Pig would have concluded. But hey, time is money!

Comments: Introducing the set, Jerry says that Billy has been 
delayed somewhere and that meanwhile "Bobby and I are going to 
regale you with some old standards ... while we're waiting around." 
Monkey & The Engineer through Uncle John's Band are acoustic (the 
whole times 38:36), and Billy makes his appearance --"There he is!" -immediately 
afterward. The next scrap of tape is the Drums 
soundchecking, and then the electric set follows. Probably this was all 
one set, with a pause of a few minutes after Uncle John to clear the 
acoustic mics and get the entire band on stage. Before All Around This 
World Jerry answers a request from the audience: "Hey it's not my 
fault if you watch TV, man. I know lots of people who don't watch any 
TV at all." Only the first 41 seconds of the Dark Star and the last 10:11 
of the Turn On Your Lovelight appear on the circulating SBD tape, and 
New Speedway Boogie is entirely missing there.

Comments: Total time [2:38:18]. The circulating soundboard cuts just 
as The Other One's last vocals are ending, and resumes immediately 
afterward near the beginning of Cosmic Charlie. Though it's missing 
on the tape, it seems almost certain that they went on to play the 
Cryptical reprise before transitting into Cosmic Charlie. Since this 
reprise varies from 2 minutes to 12 or more, it's difficult to say how 
much music is missing here. Dark Star cuts as they are gliding down 
toward the second vocals; probably around 3-4 minutes are missing 
before the end of the tune. After this cut the tape splices to the tag end 
of Alligator. It is usually assumed that the set ran Dark Star > 
Alligator, but this is a short set as the circulating tape runs, even after 
adding 3 minutes of Dark Star and 4 of Alligator, and it seems possible 
that more than that is missing here. There is a tape flip at 1:40 into the 
following Drums, but little is lost here. In the Jam out of The Eleven 
there are hints of Caution (Do Not Stop On Tracks) and of The Other 
One, but just hints. The Eleven analyzes: Drums > Eleven Jam [6:50] >

Comments: Total time [2:50:46]. Jerry announces a break after Uncle 
John. Before the second set he says "well, looks like the '70s are gonna 
be wierd." The Jam following the first Alligator hints at Goin Down 
The Road. There is a cut at 1:48 of Feedback. There is a cut at 11:19 of 
The Eleven, probably the flip of the master cassette. The Eleven 
analyzes: Drums > Eleven Jam 6:38 > Eleven vocals 0:42 > Eleven

a Merry Go Round tuning and a Dark Star tease. There is a cut in

Comments: The show begins with the 2001 theme music playing over 
the PA (the prelude of Richard Strauss' Thus Spake Zarathustra); at its 
conclusion the Dead launch into Mason's Children (this is audible on 
the AUD tape; the circulating SBD cassette cuts in on the last 3:11 of 
Mason's Children; the timing given here is from the CD). The SBD 
breaks off after 1:46 of The Other One; from here the timings are based 
on the AUD. Possibly there is an encore missing. Cold Blood and 
Lighthouse were also on the bill (DeadBase IX).

However, articles and ads in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin for 1/22 and

with the opening bands The Sun And The Moon, September Morn, and 
Pilfredge Sump, with lights by Noah's Ark. The Airplane was 
definitely not on the bill.

Comments: The tape breaks off during Cosmic Charlie; there's really

contains this list is labeled "1/29/70" but 1/30/70 seems the likelier 
date. According to Tom Constanten this was his last performance as a 
regular member of the band (Between Rock & Hard Places p. 84). 
Back at their hotel afterward, the Dead were "busted down on Bourbon 
St." Fleetwood Mac and The Flock were also on the bill (DeadBase

Comments: Technical difficulties after Hard To Handle prompt a shift

speculative title; Weir sings this tune. Before Cumberland Jerry can be 
heard proposing that they do Cumberland first, then Uncle John to end 
the set. The tape breaks off after Cumberland, however. It's difficult to 
believe the Dead didn't go on to play further electric tunes. Fleetwood

Set 2: allstar jam [#7:40#] 
Comments: Set 1 is from the Dead's set; according to DeadBase IX 
the full set went Cold Rain, Hard To Handle, Black Peter, Me & My 
Uncle, China Cat › Rider. The tape in circulation derives from a PBS 
television documentary, "San Francisco, California Sounds," filmed at 
the Family Dog on 2/4/70; DeadBase IX says it was broadcast on 
12/13/70. In addition to the Dead's three tunes, the 90-minute cassette 
includes the Airplane doing You, Me and Pooneil, Eskimo Blue Day, 
We Can Be Together, Mexico and Plastic Fantastic Lover; Santana 
doing Incident at Neshabur and Soul Sacrifice; and a jam involving 
musicians from all the bands. Set 2 is from this jam; it is already 
underway when the tape segment begins and the segment cuts before 
its conclusion. Among musicians readily audible in this fragment of 
furious jamming are Kaukonen, Garcia, Santana, Casady, Santana's 
rhythm section plus at least one more trap set, and probably Cipollina 
(the video tape should help confirm and complete the identifications). 
The 90-minute cassette in circulation also includes Quicksilver 
Messenger Service doing three tunes (Red Wings, "Sweet Baby Baby," 
and Subway); these are said to come from the production of the 
documentary from which QMS was dropped during editing. Besides 
the 90-minute cassette, video tape of the broadcast is also in 
circulation, and audio tapes dubbed from it.

get." Mason's plainly was not a set opener. In the pause after Mason's 
the tuning sounds like Cryptical might be next. The songs listed in SET

Comments: Garcia plays pedal steel guitar on the first 3 tunes. Green 
Grass cuts in on "as I step down from the train." In the pause after 
Green Grass Jerry says with droll mock sarcasm "And you thought you 
were gonna hear rock and roll." --probably Green Grass opened the 
set. In the pause after Sawmill Jerry teases Me & My Uncle repeatedly, 
but after a splice they play Seasons Of My Heart instead and when they 
do come around to Me & My Uncle, it's without the pedal steel. This 
version of Seasons Of My Heart also appears as filler on the cassettes 
of 2/8/70 AUD; it is the only performance of the tune in circulation 
(DeadBase IX lists another version on 12/31/69 but no genuine tape 
has surfaced). In the pause after Seasons Garcia shifts to electric guitar 
and they "test the monitors;" in the lengthy pause before Boss Man 
they again try to get the monitors working properly; Bobby remarks on 
the "jury-rigged house PA," observing that "I hate to point the 
incriminating finger but I wish he'd leave his shit home." This appears 
to be one set rather than two. The tape in circulation cuts off just as the

Fade Away [9:18] › St. Stephen [2:15] › Lovelight [35:07]; [0:34] % 
Comments: Total time 2:18:08 +. SET 2 timings are based on a 
composite of the AUD and SBD tapes. Bobby keeps singing Not Fade 
Away over the first 20 seconds of the St. Stephen jam; NFA is timed 
till the end of these vocals; the Stephen reprise starts 20 seconds earlier 
and so actually runs 2:35, counting the overlap. It isn't clear whether 
this represents one set or two. SET 1 is the beginning of the show. If 
there were two sets, the 1st set probably continued beyond It Hurts Me 
To, though conceivably SET 1 could be the complete set. In his 
introduction Graham first presents "Mr. Garcia" with a "photo of 
Michael J. Brody of RCA-Victor," and then gives this introduction: 
"Stars of stage, screen and radio, direct from a command performance 
in New Orleans, these are the Grateful Dead." Bobby explains the 
pause after Smokestack: "We're waitin' for the Bear to turn on his 
lovelight" --then, after a blare of feedback, "He just did." Dire Wolf 
cuts across a tape flip, with the first 1:41 of the tune before the flip, the 
last 2:23 on Side B, and 3 1/2 verses lost in the flip ("Please don't 
murder me" through "I cut my deck"). In the long tuning pause after 
Dire Wolf Phil teases Lovelight and Jerry enjoins "everybody just 
relax," several times. It Hurts Me Too does not sound like the end of a 
set. SET 2 is either the last 76 minutes of the 2nd set or the conclusion 
of a more than 2 hour single set. If the latter, then it might well follow 
immediately after It Hurts Me Too. Dark Star does not sound like the 
beginning of the set and there is no Intro. If this is the end of the 2nd set 
then probably there are around 15 minutes of tunes are missing before 
Dark Star. (The AUD tape has a cut at the end of Dark Star, in which 
the first 39 seconds of St. Stephen are lost. This looks like the taper 
taking the opportunity to flip --so there must have been around 15 
minutes previous to this 27 minute Dark Star to put its conclusion near 
the end of a 45-minute side; the AUD runs unbroken to the end of 
Lovelight after this flip.) The SBD tape in circulation begins 3:42 
before the end of Dark Star and runs for 33:04, cutting off 15:12 into 
Lovelight; the AUD supplies the remaining 19:55 of Lovelight. This 
odd scrap, too, suggests there was something unusual about the 
dimensions of the set. The AUD tape of 2/8/70 usually circulates as 2 
90-minute cassettes with filler from 2/05/70 (Mason's, Boss Man, 
Peter) & 2/07/70 (Seasons), plus the Fillmore West, San Francisco, 
California 02/??/70 Race Is On. Usually it begins with Mason's, 
Seasons, and The Race Is On, then starts the 02/8/70 SET 1, running 
through the flip in Dire Wolf. Side B continues with Dire Wolf through 
It Hurts Me Too. (Some copies of the first tape move the non-2/8/70 
material to the end of the tape but still have the flip chop in Dire Wolf, 
which proves the priority of the other arrangement; probably this flip 
isn't on the master, however.) The Big Boss Man & Black Peter appear 
after a splice following the conclusion of Lovelight on tape II B (it is 
conceivable --though very unlikely --that these are actually the tunes 
missing from before the Dark Star and not 2/5). Taj Mahal and Bigfoot 
were also on the bill (DeadBase IX).

Encore: [0:13 Intro]; Uncle John's Band [5:14]; [0:24] % 
Comments: Late Show. Total time 1:26:37 +. Duane Allman's guitar 
is audible from near the beginning of Dark Star through the end of the 
set; Gregg Allman adds organ & vocals during Lovelight, and Berry 
Oakley plays a second bass on Lovelight. According to Kenny 
Schachat, who attended the show, the guitarist audible starting about 

2:30into Dark Star and for several minutes thereafter is Peter Green, 
not Duane, who enters around the middle of Dark Star. The encore is 
acoustic Dead. The timings are from the AUD supplemented by the 
SBD. The Allman Bros and Love were also on the bill. There is also 
about 45 minutes of SBD in circulation; it starts 10:23 minutes into the 
Dark Star, with the best copies breaking off 3:41 before the end of the 
Lovelight (or cutting to an AUD patch); however, most copies of the 
SBD in circulation break off about a minute earlier. 
TAPES FROM FILLMORE EAST FEBRUARY 1970 

Reportedly it was during this Late Show that clever and industrious 
Fillmore East stagecrew members including John Chester and Alan 
Mande managed to patch a Revox reel-to-reel deck with 15-inch reels 
underneath the stage into the PA feed, and the moment when our 
circulating SBD tape picks up the Dark Star, 10:23 after its opening, is 
the moment when they managed to get their jury-rigged system 
patched together, up and running. Circulating copies of this SBD 
master break off 3:41 before the end of the Lovelight; perhaps this cut 
is on the master. In addition to this 45 minute from 2/11/70 our 
enterprising heroes taped the Late Shows on the 13th and 14th (but 
apparently not the Early Shows), and copies of these tapes have been in 
circulation since the early 70s. Bear also ran SBD masters of the 13th 
and 14th, and much of this material has now been released on Bear's 
Choice and Dick's Pick 4. However, it is unclear whether there is any 
SBD from the 11th in the vault. For the Dick's Picks 4 release, Jeffrey 
Norman patched gaps in the vault SBDs of the 13th and 14th using the 
surreptitious second SBD masters --good karma all around. The GD 
Records / Polygram Records CD, "Allman Bros Band Fillmore East 
February 1970," (GDCD 4063) releases tape of the Allmans from this 
run and may contain tunes from this date. Besides the several SBDs 
from this run there are also two AUD tapes in circulation, one of the 
2/11/70 Late Show and one of the 2/13/70 Early Show (see Comments: 
under this date). There is a complete copy of the 2/11/70 AUD master 
in circulation, and it also appears as patches for the first 10:23 of the 
Dark Star and last 3:41 of the Lovelight, otherwise missing on the 
circulating SBD tapes. The AUD of the 2/13/70 Early Show could 
easily be by the same taper as the 2/11/70 AUD. Both tapes have 
strong saturation and strong bass, and both have decent but not perfect 
mic placement, and as a result boomy in the bass with considerable hall 
resonance and audience noise. There is no evidence of AUD tape from 
the 14th in circulation.

complete Late Show Dead set. This is all one set; the band never leaves 
the stage en masse and there is no set-break. The first five tunes are 
electric Dead. At the conclusion of I Know You Rider they start to go 
into High Time but immediately pull up short. Total time for this first 
electric segment through Smokestack Lightnin is 38:35. During the 
pause after this tune the stage is re-rigged for the acoustic segment of 
the set but there is no set break and the band does not leave the stage 
en masse. From here through Katie Mae is acoustic Dead (31:47 + total 
time). The conclusion of Uncle John is clipped on the circulating tape. 
There is another extended pause while Pigpen's guitar mic is set up, 
and then he concludes the acoustic segment with Katie Mae. The 
remainder of the set is electric Dead again. This second electric 
segment of the set times 1:29:31 total. The end of the encore is clipped 
on the tape in circulation. Smokestack Lightnin, Wake Up Little Susie

SET 1 is the complete Late Show Dead set. This is all one set; the band

three tunes are electric Dead and time 14:34. During the pause after 
Hard To Handle the stage is re-rigged for the next seven tunes, which

circulating SBD of Uncle John at 1:08. The rest of the set from Dancin 
through Bid You Goodnight is electric Dead and times 1:24:19 total. 
Hard To Handle, Dark Hollow and All Around This World are

Comments: Total time 1:53:27 +. This appears to be the complete 
show. Timings are based on the AUD tape. This tape cuts in during the 
"New Speedway Boogie jam," which sounds like Bobby playing the 
comp to this song over & over while the audience claps along and the 
equipment crew tries to get the rest of the band up & running. After 

4:15this cuts to another couple minutes of tuning, soundcheck activity 
and bitching about the sound system. The show proper finally kicks in 
with Casey Jones, though the vault SBD only starts with Big Boy Pete. 
The circulating AUD is missing Me & My Uncle and King Bee, but 
they appear on the SBD. On the AUD tape China Cat cuts in at 
"kimono like a crazy-quilt star gown," and the 2nd stanza of Rider is 
clipped. These defects aside, aud tape is quite a decent job of audience 
recording. Commander Cody was also on the bill (DeadBase IX).

3/20/70 a Capitol Theater, Port Chester, New York 
Comments: We have concluded that the tape in circulation labeled 
"Capitol Theater, Port Chester 3/20/70 Early Show electric set is 
actually the Early Show electric set for June 24th --see 06/24/70a. If 
this is correct then as far as we know there is no tape currently in 
circulation of the 3/20/70 Early Show. The Village Voice ad for the 
March 20 & 21 Capitol Theater shows lists the Dead, with Catfish 
opening, shows at 8:00 and 11:00. The Early Shows appear to have 
consisted of a 70-minute electric set; presumably Catfish played an 
opening set. It isn't clear whether they also opened the Late Show. The 
Dead's Late Show set was considerably longer than the Early Show's, 
with a short acoustic mini-set inserted in the middle. The acoustic set 
listed as "6/24/70 Late Show Set 1" (also at this venue) sometimes 
circulates labeled "3/20/70 Early Show" but this seems quite 
improbable. The soundcheck listed as "Capitol Theater, Port Chester 
11/6/70 SET 1" sometimes circulates labeled "3/20/70 soundcheck;" 
this seems very unlikely, however.

Comments: The first half of Morning Dew is missing on the 
circulating tape, and there is a tape flip in the Dark Star at 4:51, before 
the first vocals; the remaining 8:54 fragment cuts in during the space 
following the vocals; probably around 2-4 minutes are lost here. These 
defects aside (and they are likely on the master) this is the complete 
show. In the pause after Me & My Uncle somebody says "Our time's 
up. See ya' later." Probably there wasn't an encore.

Encore: We Bid You Goodnight 
Comments: Total time 2:07:30 +. SET 1 is electric Dead; probably 
this is the complete set except for the opening 15 seconds or so of 
Casey Jones. It is not clear how much of a break there was between 
this and "SET" 2 --perhaps only as long as it took to set up for the 
acoustic instruments. SET 2 is acoustic Dead. Again, it is not clear how 
long a break occured after this set --perhaps only as long as it took to 
clear Pigpen's acoustic guitar mic: in the pause before the cut after 
Katie Mae it sounds like the crowd may be responding to the rest of the 
band getting ready to launch into Good Lovin behind him. However, 
after this break the tape cuts in on the beginning of Good Lovin, losing 
around 90 seconds; the Lovelight is virtually intact, the unnecessary 
tapeflip a pathetic bit of malicious mischief. The tape in circulation is 
missing the encore, which is listed as in DeadBase IX. This tape used 
to circulate labeled "Cincinnati 4/30/70" but Latvala reports that the 
vault tapes are indeed labeled 4/3/70 and argues for accepting this date. 
Ken Kesey & The Merry Pranksters and the Lemon Pipers were also 
on the bill (DeadBase IX).

Comments: Candyman through Katie Mae is acoustic Dead (27:02 + 
total), Good Lovin through Lovelight is electric (68:55 + total). 
Probably there was not a full break after Katie Mae before the band 
shifted to the electric tunes, but just long enough to remove the 
acoustic guitar mics. According to DeadBase IX, the first (electric) set 
of the evening went: Schoolgirl; Mama Tried; China Cat Sunflower › I 
Know You Rider; Viola Lee Blues. There is a tape with this list 
Grateful Dead live performances 1959 – 1995 

-59



composed of the SBD versions of these songs from 4/12/70 (it also 
circulates mislabled "Fillmore East 7/10/70"). It is possible that the DB 
IX list is based on this bogus tape, or vice versa; it is also possible, 
though much less likely, that these tunes actually belong to the 4/9/70 
first electric set and not to 4/12/70 where they are listed. Probably the 
Dead did not play three separate sets each night at this run of shows 
(Fillmore West, San Francisco, California April 9-12). It seems 
likeliest that their second set of the evening began with the acoustic 
songs and then proceeded without a significant break to a show-closing 
string of electric tunes. Miles Davis contributed an hour-long set each 
evening, and according to DeadBase Stone The Crows and Clouds 
were also on the bill. Probably each evening's concert began with sets 
from one or both of the opening acts, followed by the Dead's first 
electric set; Miles' set followed, and then the Dead concluded the 
evening with a long set that started acoustic and finished electric. 
However, on the last night they appear to have dispensed with the 
acoustic segment of their 2nd set and played one long electric set, 
including electric versions of songs performed in acoustic versions 
earlier in the run. All this is fairly speculative, however: we need better 
evidence --or, even better, eyewitness accounts. Timings are from the 
AUD. Some copies in circulation have the last couple minutes of Deep 
Elem cut, others don't. "Cowboy Song" is an instrumental 
improvisation involving audience participation on a hoe-down type riff 
with an unknown vocalist conducting in a sort of scat & yodel fashion 
(it isn't Marmaduke or Ramblin Jack or David Bromberg --maybe it's 
Nelson on acid?); this one-time-only affair never had a name --the title 
comes from tape labels. To judge by the sound of it, the Other One 
drums were cut out on the spot with the pause button (very neatly, too -
probably figured he had enough drums already out of Good Lovin). 
The Cryptical Envelopment reprise jam comes to a conclusion and the 
taper hits his pause button as the audience starts to applaud then let's go 
as the band goes directly into Me & My Uncle after this, he's learned 
his lesson and doesn't clip the conclusion nearly so close; this same 
glitch occurs at the 11/8/70 Truckin › Dark Star transition point on the 
best AUD master of this show, and certainly this tape (4/9/70) matches 
that one's quality, so perhaps it's the same taper. Quite a bit of 
Lovelight is missing, probably; Pigpen is only just starting to get 
wound up when the circulating AUD cuts. SBDs of 3 of Miles' sets 
circulate (the 10th, the 11th, and one more).

Comments: Total time 1:43:13 +. The circulating SBD for this show 
occurs in many partial selections, combinations, sequences and 
arrangements, and the tapes in circulation may not represent the whole 
of the Dead's contributions to the concert, though probably this is most 
of it. It used to be thought that some of this might actually be SBD 
from 4/9/70; none of the songs the 4/12/70 SBD has in common with 
the 4/9/70 AUD are the same performances, but it still has not been 
conclusively disproven that some of the "4/12/70 SBD" might actually 
come from the 4/9/70 1st set (as listed in DeadBase IX; there is no 
independently-identified tape of this material in circulation). See 
Comments: under 04/09/70 on the structure of these concerts. SET 1 is 
electric Dead. The Bill Graham Intro of Schoolgirl goes "If the Dead 
End Kids were alive today, they would be called "The Grateful Dead." 
Jerry sings only the first two stanzas of China Cat before jumping off 
into the jam. On the circulating SBD at the end of I Know You Rider 
they start to go into High Time but the tape cuts after 1 second. After 
the splice Good Lovin starts. This may be the complete set (besides the 
missing High Time). SET 2 is also electric throughout; there are no 
acoustic instruments audible. Jerry & Bobby both play electric on 
Candyman through Uncle John's Band (total time 27:31 +); these are 
electric performances of tunes better known during this period in 
acoustic versions (perhaps this is why DeadBase calls them acoustic"). 
The circulating tape of Candyman cuts in at the second verse, "with 
your hair a-hangin down." The circulating tape of Black Peter cuts in 
on the second verse, "see me last night" and cuts out just before "now 
let's go run and see." According to DeadBase IX a Dire Wolf followed 
Black Peter but this does not appear on circulating tapes. Both the 
completeness and the sequence of this setlist are suspect. We need 
better evidence.

Comments: Total time 1:40:20 +. SET 1 is acoustic Dead, perhaps the

There probably wasn't a NRPS set. Over the applause following Uncle 
John Jerry says "we're gonna bring on the electric Dead." According to 
Bill Ray, who attended the show, there was definitely a set break. 
SET 2 is electric Dead. It is easy to imagine that a tune or two 
featuring Bobby's vocals or Pigpen's is missing in the splices before 
and after Dire Wolf. The jam during which the reel audibly runs out 
sounds like it's heading for Good Lovin. This tape's fidelity leaves 
something to be desired for the first few minutes but by the beginning 
of Friend Of The Devil the taper gets his levels up (and the PA gets it 
together) and thereafter this is fairly decent AUD tape, not dead on in 
the sweet spot but quite listenable. Bill Ray reports that John 
Hammond opened, probably the next night as well.

Comments: Set 1 is acoustic Dead. The tunes with timings are from 
the FM-SBD. They were broadcast as "unknown date and venue 1970" 
but apparently the tape of this acoustic material is associated with the 
tape of the SET 3 material, which can be dated to 5/1/70. Set 2 is 
NRPS w/ Garcia, pedal steel. Set 3 is electric Dead. There may have 
been a second electric Dead set as well. Obviously none of this is 
complete. The NRPS tape is a questionable attribution. This set 
conclusion occurs at the beginning of a cassette which continues with 
the 5/2/70 NRPS set. Assuming this derives from a band work tape, 
that would likely make the beginning of the tape the conclusion of the 
previous gig. The SBD tape in circulation from SET 3 is usually 
mislabeled "St. Louis 5/19/70;" it's total time is 37:02; it cuts in on The 
Other One, probably soon after drums, and runs through to the end of 
Cryptical, then cuts to High Time; the Lovelight fragment follows after 
another splice; circulating copies tend to be very fast. The 99 SBD is 
not in circulation; according to Latvala there is no tape in the vault for 
this show.

SBD of the Dead's portion of this show, minus Cold Rain And Snow, 
has been released as Dick's Picks 8. Timings are based on these CDs 
except for the NRPS set and Cold Rain, which are from the circulating

plays acoustic guitar on Cumberland Blues while Jerry switches to 
electric. Nelson plays mandolin on Cold Jordan and Marmaduke adds 
bass harmony vocals. SET 2 is the complete NRPS set, with Garcia on 
pedal steel guitar. Sawmill through Me & My Uncle feature vocals by 
"special guest Bobby Ace, formerly of Cards Off The Bottom (haw)." 
There are two tapes from this set in circulation. 9 of the last 11 tunes of 
the set appear following Uncle John on side B of a cassette containing 
the rest of the 5/2/70 acoustic set on side A. The complete set except 
The Weight appears on another circulating 90 SBD cassette, following 
the last six tunes of the 5/1/70 NRPS set; this cassette probably stems 
from a band work tape (see Comments: under 05/01/70). SET 3 is the 
first electric Dead set. The first 1:45 of St. Stephen are missing on the 
master. For the second electric Dead set see 05/02/70b SET 1.

Comments: SET 1 is the second electric Dead set. AN EVENING 
WITH THE GRATEFUL DEAD MID-1970 Harpur College, 
Binghamton 5/2/70 is the first show from 1970 where we have tape of 
the complete three-part concert that comprised a Dead show in mid1970. 
Speaking to Dick Lawson in England around 5/24/70, Garcia 
said: "We're going through some transitions. Our music is not what it 
was: it's continually changing. What we've been doing in the States 
lately is having like 'an evening with the Grateful Dead.' We start off 
with acoustic music with Bobby and I playing guitars, light drums and 
very quiet electric bass. Pigpen plays the organ. Then we have a band 
we've been travelling with, The New Riders of the Purple Sage, where 
I play pedal steel, not guitar, Mickey plays drums, and three of our 
friends from the coast, musicians that we've known for a long time, are 
fronting the band. So we start off with acoustic muisc and then The 
New Riders of the Purple Sage --it's like very snappy electric country-
rock; it's kinda hard to describe --and then we come on with the 
electric Dead, so it keeps us all really interesting, and it's six hours of 
this whole development thing. By the end of the night it's very high."

Comments: Total time 1:30:48 +. SET 1 is NRPS w/ Garcia, pedal 
steel, SET2 is electric Dead. The lists are obviously incomplete and the 
order is unclear. There was probably an acoustic set before the NRPS 
set; on the structure of mid-70 Dead shows see Comments: under 
05/02/70b. The AUD tape is truly a horror, among the very worst 
masters in circulation. In the pause after Fair Chance To Know there is 
an announcement that the first aid station has eyedrops for people still 
smarting from teargas at a demonstration that afternoon in New Haven; 
it ends with a speaker urging participation in the next day's nationwide 

protests against the Viet Nam War. The end of the Good Lovin jam 
features Phil soloing with the drummers. Bobby plays acoustic on New 
Speedway. It's a pity there isn't better tape of this show. The jam out of 
Lovelight wanders some, and has a way rowdy crowd to contend with 
(probably they do the Main Ten mainly to throw the clappers), but it 
has many incendiary stretches, including an extended passage of proto-
Martian Blues jamming around 15 minutes in (the best known version 
of this jam occurs during Playin at the Cow Palace 12/31/76).

Comments: Total time 4:21:32 +. These timings represent a composite 
of the two circulating AUD masters. On the structure of mid-70 Dead 
shows see Comments: under 5/2/70b. SET 1 is acoustic Dead. Jerry 
plays electric guitar on Cumberland and New Speedway Boogie, while 
Bobby continues on acoustic guitar. Apparently David Nelson adds a 
second acoustic guitar to New Speedway and perhaps Cumberland, 
since Bobby & Jerry both introduce him after New Speedway; it is 
very difficult to pick out his guitar on the circulating tapes, however. 
SET 2 is NRPS with Garcia, pedal steel. The cut in Fair Chance To 
Know is the tape flip; it's harder to figure what happened with the cut 
before Seasons --it may not be on the master. Somebody adds soaring 
harmony vocals to Last Lonely Eagle. The Race Is On, Seasons, and 
Mama Tried › Sawmill feature vocals by "special guest star Bobby 
Ace, formerly of Bobby Ace And The Cards Off The Bottom." SET 3 
is electric Dead. By way of introduction to Dire Wolf Jerry says

"This is a little paranoid-in-the-streets mantra --if you want to think of 
it that way." Beat It On Down The Line gets 30 beats in response to an 
audience-member's reply to the question "What's a good number?" --at 
first this query elicits cries for "Alligator" & Jerry replies "He didn't 
mean that kind of number. He meant the other kind of number --you 
know, 'one, two...' ." The jam after the Darkness Darkness jam includes 
hints of NFA, Lovelight, Caution and the St. Stephen jam. There was 
no encore. Together the two circulating AUD masters from this show 
present us with that rare thing, a recording of the (nearly) complete 
sequence of events at your typical mid-1970 3-set show (acoustic Dead 
-NRPS -electric Dead) --and a generous high-energy show at that. 
Circulating copies of the more nearly complete AUD master contain 
the entire show except a few cuts and glitches; notably, this master has 
several cuts in the NRPS set (listed above), is missing the first couple 
bars of Easy Wind, loses levels late in this tune, and is missing Frozen 
Logger and the first 2:05 of the drums › Not Fade Away. There are at 
least two different copies of this master in circulation, one that's been 
around for more than a decade, marked by its omission of the NRPS 
set, and the other, apparently from a much more recent retranscription 
of the master, which includes the NRPS set. The more complete 
version tends to be cleaner as well; the other glitches are on both 
copies & presumably on the master. The circulating copy of the 
second AUD master contains 70 minutes of excerpts from the electric 
Dead set, (#Cold Rain; Dire Wolf; Easy Wind; Beat It; High Time; 
That's It › Cosmic Charlie; King Bee; Frozen Logger; and Not Fade 
Away, which breaks off near the end); this is sufficient to cover all the 
electric set flaws on the first master but offers no help with the NRPS 
set. Both masters make very listenable AUD tape. The mics for the 
more nearly complete master were placed further back; it has more 
audience noise on it, including the party among whom it was recorded, 
who have quite an amusing party but manage to be quite during songs. 
The 70 minute excerpts tape has much less audience noise, and a crisp 
bass; the mics were much closer in, and this tape sometimes circulates 
mislabeled "SBD."

Comments: Total time 3:09:45 +. On the structure of mid-70 Dead 
shows see Comments: under 05/02/70b. SET 1 is acoustic Dead. 
Throughout the first five tunes they are plagued by monitor sound 
problems and the pauses between songs are full of efforts to fix them. 
After Candyman Bobby says "Jerry broke a string, and so, we're gonna 
do some more relaxin'." On the circulating tape this is followed by a 
splice, after which a voice (A Cutler? Which one?) comes up on the 
PA and says "Can Bob Matthews come up on stage and sort out the 
sound system which isn't working." After another splice the NRPS set 
opener follows (SET 2). Probably several tunes are missing to 
complete the acoustic set --for one thing there's nothing from Pigpen. 
(Some copies have the 5/1/70 SBD Little Susie and Uncle John's as fill 
on II B --not to be mistaken for part of the missing acoustic set of 
5/14/70.) SET 2 is the NPRS set with Garcia, pedal steel. After 
Whatcha Gonna Do someone asks Jerry if it's OK, then announces 
"Alright we're gonna open the back doors and let everybody else in 
free." Monitor level problems continue during this set. Marmaduke 
introduces Henry as "our dope-smuggler song --it's a fantasy." The 
tape cuts 33 seconds into this tune; when the signal resumes they are 
yet again trying to get the monitors and PA working right. Marmaduke 
wonders if the theatrical lighting is drawing power off the PA & 
suggests turning it down. 2 minutes later they restart Henry but this 
version too fades down incomplete. After another splice Garden Of 
Eden begins. After Lodi the drummer starts Honkytonk Woman but the 
band doesn't follow, he drops it, they pause, then start The Weight 
instead (which cuts off after only 13 seconds on the circulating tapes). 
Both tunes were set-closers for NRPS; they might have closed this set 
with The Weight or gone on to close with Honkytonk. These various 
cuts aside (some arising from technical difficulties at the show), the 
tape in circulation appears to represent a complete set. It seems 
possible the master includes the rest of The Weight. SET 3 is electric 
Dead. This may be the entire set or it may be missing a song or two. 
The proper order of songs before New Speedway Boogie is uncertain. 
There are two sources for this show's electric set, an 80 minute SBD 
and a 45 minute FM-SBD. The 80 SBD contains (in this order) Casey 
Jones › Mama Tired › High Time › Schoolgirl % Me & My Uncle % 
Cold Rain & Snow; Attics Of My Life; Cumberland Blues % ... 
(followed by the sequence from New Speedway through Lovelight). 
The 45 FM-SBD contains (in this order) Casey Jones % China Cat › 
Rider % Mama Tried › High Time % Good Lovin' % Schoolgirl. It is 
possible that the Casey Jones › Mama Tried transition on the SBD is 
actually a very clean splice (too clean to hear), but it is certain that the 
FM-SBD Casey Jones is followed by a splice and the Rider by another. 
The SBD's High Time › Schoolgirl transition is blatant and the 
sequence from Cold Rain through Cumberland equally so (no splices). 
This still leaves it unclear where the China Cat › Rider belongs, where 
the Good Lovin belongs, and where Me & My Uncle belongs.

Reportedly there is a Dire Wolf after Me & My Uncle, but evidence 
has not been forthcoming (I have seen "Dire Wolf" on the label of the 
80 SBD but the tape, when consulted, proved not to contain it). And 
there may be other songs still missing from this set. The arrangement 
proposed in SET 3 is a best guess based on imperfect evidence -which 
is what we need more of, and better. The encore is with David 
Nelson, mandolin, and Marmaduke, bass vocals; it does not appear on 
the circulating tapes and is listed here according to Gordon Sharpless's 
report. According to Dick Latvala there is no Mama Tried on the vault 
SBD; however, since it appears on both the circulating SBD and also 
on the FM-SBD, this seems likely to be a mistake. We will consult him 
again about it. The circulating SBD of this song has one verse clipped 
a few seconds before the end of the song; the FM-SBD does not share 
this defect.

On the structure of mid-70 Dead shows see Comments: under 
05/02/70b. SET 1 is the Early Show acoustic Dead set. On Cumberland 
and New Speedway David Nelson joins in on acoustic guitar while 
Jerry shifts to electric. On Cold Jordan Nelson switches to mandolin. 
Marmaduke adds harmony vocals to the last three tunes. Pigpen plays 
organ on New Speedway. SET 2 is from the Early Show NRPS set 
with Garcia, pedal steel. This is about half their set – all there is on the 
master. Before Last Lonely Eagle Marmaduke asks where's "Bobby 
Ace" --probably Weir was a guest vocalist later in the set. SET 3 is 
electric Dead. Before St. Stephen Pigpen says "Alright you people, you 
know who you are." Enterprising Fillmore East stagecrew patched a 
reel-to-reel machine underneath the stage into the PA feed and saved 
most of this show for us and eternity. They were busy setting up for the 
Early Show electric Dead set and blew their flip during the Early Show 
NRPS set, losing the second half of that set as a result, but the rest of 
this enormous evening's proceedings are recorded in their entirety. The 
master has only the left channel through the middle of Candyman 
(there are also splitter-generated 2-channel mono copies circulating). 
Around 4 hours of this show were broadcast by KPFA-FM Berkeley in 
1971, further speeding the propagation of this tape (some early FM 
copies are dated "6/21/71;" this may be the date of the broadcast). For 
many years 5/15/70 was THE representative 1970 Dead tape --Harpur 
College 5/2/70 and Winterland, San Francisco, California 10/4/70 its 
only rivals for wide circulation.

Comments: This is the Late Show. Late show total time 3:58:55 +. 
Early & Late Shows total time 6:33:29 +. SET 1 is the Late Show 
acoustic Dead set complete. David Nelson plays mandolin on I Hear A 
Voice Callin and Marmaduke adds bass vocals. SET 2 is the complete 
Late Show NRPS set with Garcia, pedal steel. Bob Weir guests on 
vocals for Mama Tried, Sawmill and Me And My Uncle. There is a 
brief cut in Sawmill, with less than 10 seconds lost. After this set the 
master contains 15:13 of continuing signal, comprising parts of Side B 
of Abbey Road (playing on the PA during the break) interspersed with 
the sounds of the stage being rigged – drums nailed down, etc -followed 
by the sounds of tuning up. SET 3 is electric Dead. Beat It On 
Down The Line gets 14 beats. There is a cut 2:17 into St. Stephen; 
probably around 60 -90 seconds are missing here. There is a cut 
13:33 into Lovelight, but probably only a few seconds are lost. Over 
the last year it has been rumored that there is another SBD master of 
this show in the vault, which includes the rest of the Early Show NRPS 
set (and which would probably allow us to patch the few other glitches 
on the circulating master); however, nothing has emerged besides 
rumors thus far. Meanwhile, we owe an enormous debt of gratitude to 
those resourceful Fillmore East crewmembers who took the bull by the 
horns and MADE TAPE. Muchas Garcias, guys.

Comments: This is the complete Dead set. Timings are from a 
combination of the AUD and the SBD. Several bandmembers said this 
was the coldest audience they ever played for, and you can feel them 
straining mightily to finally achieve liftoff over the 33:14 span of the 
showclosing Lovelight. A bit more than a minute into the Attics 
someone (Phil?) can be heard in the left channel calling out "E --E 
chord" to Bobby --Attics was still new. There is a Dancin tease at 

18:03 into Dark Star. There is a cut 23:16 into the Lovelight on the 
AUD, probably a tape flip, with 20-40 seconds lost. The AUD tape 
contains the complete show, the circulating SBD only Cryptical 
Envelopment through Lovelight (80:31 total), and the SBD Lovelight 
(it times 7:38 total) has fully 25:36 cut out starting at 5:59 (this must be

Encore: [1:13 emcee] % Minglewood [2:55#] 
Comments: Total time 69:09 +. Early Show. As far as we know this 
tape only circulates labeled "Capitol Theater, Port Chester 3/20/70 
Early Show." However, Gary Lambert notices that the Intro on the tape 
(by the show's producer, Howard Stein) goes "Ladies and Gentlemen, 
the Capitol is proud to have back ... The Grateful Dead" --and points 
out that the shows on March 20 and 21st were the Dead's first run at 
this venue, the June shows their return. He adds that the tape's contents 
fit with someone's tape of the Early Show while waiting to get in to the 
Late Show that night. Dwight Holmes has studied solos from this tape 
in comparison with other performances from Spring and from Summer, 
and says this supports dating the tape to June. The Good Lovin, too, is 
more suggestive of June than March. Altogether the case seems strong 
for re-dating this tape, and we now list it here as the June 24 Early 
Show electric set. It would still be nice to turn up corroborating 
evidence. The Capitol Theater's ads for the Dead shows on 6/24/70 
read: "Wednesday, June 24 | 8 PM & Midnight / 3 hours with | 
GRATEFUL DEAD | Alone with no other act." Apparently in June the 
New Riders weren't yet considered an "other act," since we have one of 
their sets from the evening --and indeed at this point, with Jerry on 
pedal steel full time and Phil & one of the drummers often taking part 
as well, and Bobby a more than occasional guest vocalist, the two 
bands were not yet completely differentiated. It is clear from the tapes 
that the Late Show on June 24th consisted of the classic 3-set Dead 
show of mid-70 (acoustic Dead --NRPS --electric Dead). It is not 
clear whether the Early Show also had this structure or whether it 
consisted solely of a single electric set --the tape listed here. (It is just 
possible that the fragment of a NRPS set listed below as from the Late 
Show is actually from the Early.) This is quite a good job of AUD 
taping. There is a tape-flip 9:51 into the Good Lovin sequence; side B 

begins with the concluding vocals and runs 1:21; probably less than a 
minute is lost here and probably this flip is not on the master. It also 
seems likely that the master contains a complete copy of the encore.

Sweet Chariot [3:08]; [0:10] 
Comments: Total time 2:15:35 +. SET 1 is acoustic Dead. Pigpen's 
harmonica is prominent on several tunes. Jerry plays electric guitar on 
Cumberland Blues. David Nelson plays mandolin on Cold Jordan and 
Marmaduke adds bass vocals. It's probable there are songs missing in 
the splices between songs during the 2nd half of the set and after Cold 
Jordan. The first 5 songs also circulate labeled "3/20/70 Early Show;" 
this seems very unlikely, however --see Comments: under 3/20/70a. 
SET 2 is the first 8 songs of a NRPS set with Garcia, pedal steel; we 
are missing 2-8 more songs to conclude the set. The taper has trouble 
with his mics at several points (notice the cuts, too) and this may be all 
of the set this taper managed to record. Probably this is the same taper 
as the acoustic set, but he has moved his mics. The acoustic set is a 
fairly decent job of taping, but this approaches prime. SET 3 is an 
electric set. This could be the complete set or possibly one or more 
songs could be missing after Me & My Uncle. It sounds as if the mics 
were moved before Dark Star; after Me & My Uncle the recording is 
truly excellent. Phil starts to go into High Time at the end of Rider but 
pulls up short immediately. It seems clear they ended the set here, 
however. After the first encore lengthy cheering over Judy Collins' 
recording of Richard Farina's Pack Up Your Sorrows playing on the 
PA finally yields a second encore. Swing Low Sweet Chariot is 
acoustic Dead with Marmaduke bass vocals & David Nelson, 
mandolin. An anonymous lady provides harmony vocal 
accompaniment from rather close to the mics during much of the 
second encore, alternately disconcerting and endearing.

are quite certain that they would have known if there were another 
show the next night, and they say there wasn't. Next, for several years 
the consensus was that this must be from the 6/24/70 Early Show, but 
this is rendered impossible by our identification of the old supposed 
"3/20/70 Early Show" tape as actually being the 6/24/70 Early Show 
(see Comments: on both these shows for more). Meanwhile closer 
scrutiny of the tape itself shows that it is at least in part a composite of 
several shows, leaving the issue of the identify of the rest of the tape 
still more vexed. The contents of the tape in circulation are as follows: 
Side A begins with the 3 tunes listed in SET 1 above; these tracks have 
been crosschecked against the other two instances of this sequence 
known from the period (12/12/69 & 8/19/70) and they are neither. 
Following this after a splice, Side A continues with the Minglewood 
from the 7/11/70 AUD (probably the same master but an inferior 
copy). Next on Side A after another splice comes the segment listed in 
SET 2 above; there is no other instance of this sequence from the 
period (and it is not a splice-job fake). After a third splice the side 
concludes with an electric Big RR Blues [4:05]; this has been 
crosschecked against the other available electric versions from the 
period (10/30/70, 12/26/70, 12/28/70) and is none of them; DeadBase 
IX lists another electric Big RR on 12/12/70 but no tape is currently 
available. Probably the Big RR is filler from a different show; it 
requires a different speed correction and it sounds like a different mic 
placement, venue & crowd; clearly it dates from fall 70 or conceivably 
winter 71, probably an east coast venue --best guess Capitol Theater, 
Port Chester November 11/7/70 Early Show. Side B begins with the 
sequence listed in SET 3 above --this list also has no similar in the 
period --and concludes with two pieces of fill, the 11/8/70 Around 
And Around and an AUD version of the 4/6/71 Oh Boy (otherwise 
only circulating in SBD). This tape appears to be a compilation from 
the NYC area in mid-to-late 70 and early 71; all seven pieces 
composing it sound like 1970 AUD from smallish venues with an east 
coast crowd. Obviously the whole affair suspicious, but the Big RR 
Blues aside, the fidelity, ambience and vibe of the three longer 
segments all sound like the same taper and venue, and the ambience, 
vibe and novel setlists all suggest the Capitol Theater, Port Chester, in 
June or November. A second possibility might be the Fillmore East 
shows on July 9 or 10, for which no tapes are known to exist, but the 
crowd sounds far too mellow to be the Fillmore East. The fact that 
each of these segments requires a different speed correction could 
imply that they do not come from the same show --but perhaps not. If 
we assume the three listed segments belong to the same show then the 
order listed here seems most likely (the sequence of the tape), perhaps 
in one set or perhaps in two, with the segment listed under SET 3 being 
in the second set; plainly one way or the other there are a number of 
songs missing. DeadBase IX arranges them in the order of SET 1 + 
Minglewood (actually 7/11/70) + SET 3 + SET 2 + Viola Lee Blues. 
There is no sign of a Viola Lee in circulation and no apparent warrant 
for DeadBase's sequence. This tape remains a largely unsolved 
puzzle.

7/10/70 Fillmore East, New York, New York 
Comments: See comments under 07/09/70 on the structure of this 
concert. David Ross attended this show. He remembers that among 
other songs they played "a Dire Wolf with Jerry on pedal steel guitar 
during one of the acoustic sets, and an Uncle John's Band... a Casey 
Jones, a Dark Star and a Morning Dew." His phrase, "one of the 
acoustic sets," reflects how difficult it was to tell the acoustic Dead sets 
from the NRPS sets in 1970. He also suggests that there might have 
been more than one electric set (cf. 11/7/70). There are at least 2 bogus 
tapes in circulation mislabeled with this venue & date, but nothing 
genuine (2/98); one of the bogus tapes is actually 4/12/70 (it starts with 
the Bill Graham Intro of Schoolgirl: "If the Dead End Kids were alive 
today, they would be called "The Grateful Dead").

Comments: Total time 3:23:37 +. See Comments: under 07/09/70 on 
the structure of this show. This list and the timings are based on Kenny 
Schachat's AUD tape of the show; his mics were about 15 rows back in 
the center orchestra and the tapes are in the A minus range for the 
period. As often on masters from this period, tape pauses between 
nearly every tune ("to save batteries"). There are also copies of another 
master in circulation, containing the second half of the acoustic set, and 
nearly all the electric set with the sequence completely scrambled. 
Circulating copies are higher generation and it's difficult to tell how 
kind the master itself might sound. SET 1 is acoustic Dead. David 
Nelson plays mandolin on Rosalie McFall, I Hear A Voice Callin, Cold 
Jordan and Swing Low Sweet Chariot. Jerry plays electric guitar on 
New Speedway, but Bobby still acoustic. So Sad (To Watch Good 
Love Go Bad) is an Everly Brothers tune. Marmaduke contributes bass 
vocals to the gospel tunes. SET 2 is NRPS with Garcia, pedal steel. 
This seems a little short to be the complete set, but at 2:00 AM 
apparently it was. SET 3 is the electric Dead set, apparently complete. 
The Not Fade Away is expansively jammed out. There are Mountain 
jam allusions around 6:00 and for several minutes starting around 8:00 
they weave The Other One in and out of Not Fade. There is at least 
one bogus tape in circulation mislabeled with this venue & date.

Comments: Total time 2:47:49. See Comments: under 07/09/70 on the 
structure of this show. SET 1 is acoustic Dead, with David Nelson, 
mandolin, on Rosalie McFall & Tell It To Me. Jerry plays electric on 
Cumberland, Bobby is still acoustic. Probably this is not the complete 
acoustic set; likely it ended with some gospel tunes. It was followed by 
a NRPS set; no tape of this is in circulation at present (2/98). SET 2 is 
electric Dead. This tape leaves considerable to be desired, but you can 
hear the show pretty much, and it's the Grateful Dead for sure.

Comments: SET 1 is acoustic Dead, and could well be the complete 
set. David Crosby plays 12-string guitar on Cumberland and New 
Speedway, and Jerry plays electric on these tunes. According to 
Latvala the vault tape of SET 1 starts with Friend Of The Devil and 
runs through Deep Elem; the rest is "damaged or unlistenable." The 
best tapes of this set supplement the vault SBD by patching in a truly 
excellent AUD which supplies Don't Ease, Cumberland and New 
Speedway. The AUD Don't Ease is patched in before Friend Of The 
Devil. After the SBD Deep Elem there is a splice, followed by 0:04 
from the beginning of a SBD version of New Speedway, followed by 
another splice, followed by the AUD Cumberland, another splice and 
then the AUD New Speedway. Besides these patches there is no other 
sign of this AUD tape in circulation. SET 2 is electric Dead. 
According to DeadBase IX the electric set began with Frozen Logger. 
David Crosby, NRPS, and Rubber Duck Company with Tom 
Constanten were also on the bill (DeadBase IX).

Comments: This was Bear's going away party. The SBD tape in 
circulation cuts in during China Cat Sunflower. Janis Joplin enters to 
cheers before Lovelight with "whadda you know that I know?" 
eliciting ribaldries from several bandmembers (not the last). The only 
word for Janis & Pigpen's vocals on this tune is orgiastic. DeadBase IX 
lists Lovelight; Me & My Uncle; Cold Rain & Snow before China Cat 
Sunflower, and a second electric set: Casey Jones; Attics Of My Life; 
Cumberland Blues; Not Fade Away › St. Stephen; Uncle John's Band. 
It seems probable that there's more of this in the vault. NRPS and

Comments: Weir, vocals & acoustic guitar; Garcia, pedal steel guitar;

circulates labeled "Garage Tape 1970" and sounds like it could easily 
have been made in somebody's garage studio, probably in the north 
Bay Area. Sometimes it circulates labeled "Bobby Ace & the Cards 
Off the Bottom of the Deck, Studio, 1970." The material & 
performance point plainly to 1970, and to April through August. Sear's 
presence on 8/18 & 19/70 suggest dating it to August. Weir seems to 
be in charge. Before Let Me In Bobby says "Let's do that slow number. 
If you feel like cryin', why, just go ahead." The tape cuts off with 
Bobby saying "Leave that door open, or I'll kill ya."

shows see Comments: under 05/02/70b. SET 1 is acoustic Dead; this is 
the complete set. Pigpen plays piano on Truckin, Ripple & New 
Speedway. Jerry switches to electric guitar on New Speedway. David 
Nelson plays mandolin on Rosalie McFall, Cold Jordan & Swing Low. 
Marmaduke adds bass vocals to Cold Jordan and Swing Low. The 
introduction goes: "Good evening and welcome to the Fillmore West. 
Tonight you're going to spend an evening with the Grateful Dead." 
SET 2 is NRPS w/ Garcia, pedal steel, and possibly Lesh on bass. They 
are introduced with "A hearty hi ho silver for the New Riders Of The 
Purple Sage." The circulating copy of this tape contains less than the 
first half of the complete NRPS set. Marmaduke introduces Brown 
Eyed Handsome Man as "a little Chuck Berry action for ya." SET 3 is 
electric Dead. The introduction is "For those of you who follow 
baseball, direct from the Woodacre training camp, the Grateful Dead." 
There is a DAT in circulation of a 2nd gen copy of this excellent AUD 
tape, but it contains only the Dead sets. The NRPS material circulates 
on side B of the acoustic set cassette, following Cold Jordan › Swing 
Low. Probably the rest of the NRPS set is on the master & needs to be 
put into circulation.

Comments: Total time 2:36:07 +. On the structure of mid-70 Dead 
shows see Comments: under 05/02/70b. SET 1 is acoustic Dead. David 
Nelson plays mandolin on Friend Of The Devil, Dark Hollow, Tell It 
To Me, Rosalie McFall, Cold Jordan and Swing Low. Pigpen plays 
piano on How Long Blues, Candyman, Ripple, Truckin, and New 
Speedway. There's a hint of harmonica at the beginning of Ripple; it 
seems too discreet to be Pigpen's. Jerry plays electric guitar on 
Cumberland and New Speedway while Bobby continues acoustic. 
Marmaduke provides bass vocal accompaniment on Cold Jordan and 
Swing Low. It seems probable that this set as listed is missing a tune 
from Pigpen (compare Operator the previous night). This set was 
preceded starting at 8:00 by an unbilled opening set from a bluegrass 
vocals quartet, possibly the Rowan Bros. SET 2 is from the NRPS set 
with Garcia, pedal steel, and possibly Lesh on bass. Six Days On The 
Road opens the set; the circulating tape contains only the first 3 songs. 
The Weight followed by Honkytonk Woman closed the set, which 
included a half dozen more tunes from the first NRPS album – All I 
Ever Wanted, Last Lonely Eagle & Dirty Business almost certainly 
among them. SET 3 is electric Dead. The introduction goes: "Out of 
the backwoods of Marin County, sometimes known as the Kodiak 
Woodchuck Motherfuckers, The Grateful Dead!" After Easy Wind 
Jerry announces "the first broken string in this set." Sugar Magnolia 
concludes without Sunshine Daydream. The third guitar in Not Fade › 
Lovelight is probably David Crosby. "Excuse me, young lady, would 
you like to fuck?" is the approach Pigpen recommends around 12 
minutes into this epic Lovelight --then, at the end, "See y'all later." 
There was no encore. There is a DAT in circulation from 2nd gen reels 
of this excellent AUD tape; it contains Monkey through Rosalie from 
Set 1 and the whole of Set 3. The first 3 tunes of the NRPS set circulate 
on cassette.

Comments: Total time 1:56:52 +. Set 1 is acoustic Dead, perhaps the 
complete set (though the AUD in circulation is missing most of Swing 
Low). The tape begins with Truckin, which has a piano loud in the PA 
mix; this is halted after 18 seconds by Garcia's shouts of "Hold it! 
Monitors! We won't play without the monitors." During the following 
banter Phil proposes "If you got a yellow dog bring him up here and 
we'll screw him." When they restart Truckin Garcia calls out over its 
opening "Bring the piano down!" and it comes down in the PA mix 
over the next 20 seconds or so. Pigpen also plays piano on Brokedown 
Palace and Box Of Rain. David Nelson plays mandolin on Dark 
Hollow, Friend Of The Devil, Ripple, Rosalie McFall, Cold Jordan and 
Swing Low. Set 2 is the beginning of the NRPS set. We must be 
missing at least another half dozen songs or so to make up the 
complete set. Probably the rest of the set exists on the AUD masters. 
Set 3 is electric Dead, also obviously a partial set, probably the 
conclusion of the show. This is one of the major Dark Stars of the year. 
About 3 minutes after the 2nd drums in Good Lovin Phil trios with the 
drummers for a minute or so. This is a listenable AUD tape; the mics 
are a ways back in the hall but the band is still decently audible and the 
audience noise is miraculously minimal for the venue. It was mastered 
by Jack Toner. There are four versions of the AUD master of the Dark 
Star sequence in circulation. There is an old cassette off reels that 
contains only the Dark Star but includes the opening 0:28 of the Dark 
Star, which is missing on the three other versions. Of these three, one 
(a 50-minute cassette side) starts with the Sugar Mag and then cuts to 
the Dark Star fragment and breaks off 0:37 before the end of Good 
Lovin; one (a 45-minute cassette side) starts with the Dark Star 
fragment and runs to the cut in Good Lovin, and one (a 50-minute 
cassette side) starts with the Dark Star fragment and runs through to 
the end of Good Lovin complete. There are now also composites of the 
old tape from reels and the newer ones in circulation, making up 
complete versions of this sequence. It seems probable that much more 
of this show exists on the AUD masters than is presently circulating or 
cataloged here (2/98). It would be nice to bring them into circulation 
complete. See Comments: under 9/18/70 on the SBDs of this run.

plays piano on Truckin. David Nelson plays mandolin on Black Peter 
and Rosalie McFall. During Black Peter, after "Go beneath the 
ground," Jerry stops the song cold, saying (in his most serious voice) 
"Hold it. This is insane, man. I'm sorry but it's just horrible up here. 
Really awful." The PA sound on the AUD tape isn't horrific, though 
the mix is muddy, but presumably the monitor sound was much worse. 
Here my copy of this AUD master tape cuts to the beginning of the 
NRPS set but it's difficult to believe that this master doesn't contain the 
rest of the set. From here a 45 minute partial copy of a second AUD 
master picks up the story from when they resume the acoustic set with 
Don't Ease Me In through New Speedway Boogie. Jerry plays electric 
guitar on Cumberland and New Speedway. The tag end of this tape 
suggests that the set continued, probably concluding with a few gospel 
tunes, perhaps preceded by a guest appearance by Bobby Ace. This 
second AUD master is a rather bad job of taping; for the present we 
have no positive proof that it actually is what it's labeled as, but no 
specific cause for doubt, either. Set 2 is NRPS with Garcia, pedal steel 
guitar. This is probably the complete set. Bobby is featured vocalist on 
The Race Is On, Mama Tried and Sawmill. Set 3 is an electric Dead 
set, probably complete. The first 15 seconds of Casey Jones are clipped 
on the circulating AUD tape. There are speed glitches on the master 
during the first Cryptical produced by the deck being jostled as 
someone passes; this problem recurs at several points during the set. In 
the pause before Dancin one of the drummers starts the Not Fade drum 
pattern and then pulls up short after one round when the band doesn't 
follow --"Aw, no dice" is the taper's comment. There is a cut in the 
AUD tape's St. Stephen starting at 3:29; approximately 40 seconds are 
missing here --probably a tape flip. The jam out of Not Fade Away 
starts teasing Goin Down The Road early on but never resolves into it 
either before or after the Bid You Goodnight jam. For the first 1:02 
after the Good Lovin drums Phil solos with the drummers. The 
demonstration demanding an encore goes on over the Youngblood's 
version of Get Together playing on the PA. This AUD master makes 
fairly decent listening. The mics aren't right up front but they're not as 
far back in the hall as on 9/17/70 so the tape has better saturation and 
presence, and the audience noise isn't much worse --in fact, to judge 
from the audience noise these tapes were made from a balcony rail. 
The SBD in circulation runs from Operator through the encore, 
approximately 50 minutes. The FM-SBD in circulation is the same tape 
less the cheering before the encore. SBD TAPES OF THE 
SEPTEMBER 1970 FILLMORE EAST SHOWS As they did in 
February and May '70, enterprising Fillmore East stagecrew patched a 
reel-to-reel deck under the stage into the PA feed and made SBD 
masters of the September '70 Fillmore East run. It is not clear how 
much of the run they managed to master. At present (2/98) no SBD 
tape from 9/17/70 has emerged into circulation but this does not mean 
that no masters exist. Several years ago about 50 minutes of SBD 
excerpts from the 9/18/70 electric Dead set (Operator through the 
encore) came into circulation, initially as FM-SBD broadcast by David 
Gans. During the same period approximately 65 minutes of SBD 
excerpts from the 9/19/70 electric Dead set came into circulation the 
same way. Two SBD cassettes from 9/20/70 have been in circulation 
for more than 20 years; they contain both the acoustic and electric 
Dead sets nearly complete but nothing of the NRPS set. Plainly a great 
deal of this run of shows has not yet emerged into circulation on SBD 
tape. To judge from the nearly complete SBD of 5/15/70 made by the 
same tapers, it seems plausible to assume that all four September 
shows were taped in their entirety, including the NRPS sets. Moreover, 
Gans stated that the SBD tape of 9/18/70 includes versions of Truckin 
and Black Peter; if this is so it suggests that the whole concert was 
taped since these tunes are from the beginning of the show. It seems 
plausible to assume, then, that complete SBD masters of all these 
shows exist. Whatever these masters contain, they are not in the vault; 
they are said to reside on the East Coast.

Comments: Total time 2:58:05 +. Timings are from the AUD tape 
supplemented by the SBD. See Comments: under 9/17/70 on the 
structure of this show. Set 1 is acoustic Dead, obviously an incomplete 
set. Pigpen plays piano on To Lay Me Down. David Nelson plays 
mandolin on Deep Elem, Cold Jordan and Swing Low, and 
Marmaduke sings bass harmony on these tunes. Set 2 is NRPS, not 
quite a complete set, but close. Workingman's Blues is probably the 
opening tune, though perhaps not. Louisiana Lady may not actually 
belong to this set. There are probably another 2-4 tunes missing to 
make the complete set, though conceivably more, particularly if Bobby 
Ace sat in, as he probably did. Set 3 is electric Dead, the complete 
set. A ripe Dark Star, definitely, but the 17th is the first magnitude Star 
of the run. This is the Lovelight in which Bobby (at 10:45 or so) asks 
the immortal quesion "Pigpen, did you say 'fuck'?" Afterward Pigpen 
finally dismisses the audience's cheering demand for an encore with 
the rhetorical question "Why don't you guys go home and fuck 
somebody!" The SBD and FM-SBD contain Dark Star through 
Lovelight; the AUD contains the entire list. See Comments: under 
9/18/70 on the SBDs of this run. The AUD master's mics aren't way 
back in the hall but they're not close up front either; audience noise 
isn't bad for this venue --the balcony rail is again a possible location. 
There are some horrifically high gen copies of this master in 
circulation; they sound extremely godawful, but low gen copies are 
fairly listenable. It seems reasonable to assume that the AUD master 
contains the complete acoustic and NRPS sets; it certainly would be 
nice if a complete copy emerged into circulation.

joins with another mandolin on Big RR Blues; both continue through 
Ripple. There is a hint of harmonica on Dark Hollow, presumably 
Pigpen's. Pigpen plays piano on To Lay Me Down and continues on 
Truckin. For To Lay Me Down Jerry shifts to electric guitar. Nelson & 
Grisman return on mandolin for Rosalie McFall. Jerry switches to 
electric guitar again for Cumberland and New Speedway, then back to 
acoustic for Brokedown Palace. Pigpen plays piano again on this tune. 
SET 2 is an electric Dead set. There was also a NRPS set between the 
acoustic and electric Dead sets but tape hasn't surfaced. Candyman cuts 
in at "Good morning Mr. Benson." Good Lovin cuts in toward the end 
of the jam; most of the tune is missing, 8 minutes or more. During the 
jam out of Not Fade Away Jerry feints at Goin Down The Road and 
Mountain jam but settles into neither before transiting into the Bid You 
Goodnight jam. This Caution has few rivals from any year, and the 
Feedback that follows is "buzz-saw music" at its best. SBD cassette 
tapes of the acoustic and electric Dead sets of this show have been 
circulating since the mid-70s at the latest. This accounts for the 
complete absence of AUD tape in circulation, though AUD masters 
were probably recorded. If they still exist it would be interesting to 
consult them, particularly since they might include the NRPS set, of 
which there is no sign in SBD. All copies of the SBD cassettes in 
circulation are somewhat degraded, including the lowest generation 
copies from the best sources and the oldest copies. Perhaps there is a 
problem on the master SBD. See Comments: under 9/18/70 on the 
SBDs of this run. See Comments: under 09/25/70 for more on the

9/25/70 Civic Auditorium, Pasadena, California 
Comments: This information according to Book Of The Dead Heads 
and DeadBase IX. The acoustic set of the 9/20/70 SBD tape is also in 
very limited circulation labeled "Pasadena 9/25/70." At the end of this 
acoustic set Jerry says "See ya later" and on the strength of this it has 
been argued that in fact this acoustic set is not the acoustic set for 
9/20/70 but a complete acoustic show or complete second set from an 
acoustic show played in Pasadena on 9/25/70 (compare the acoustic 
show in San Diego on 8/5/70). This argument probably puts too 
much weight on Jerry's phrase. There are other examples of him using 
such a locution to end a first set and this acoustic set has been linked 
with the electric set material in circulation for more than 20 years. 
However, it is just possible that this argument is in fact correct. There 
is no SBD of this show in the vault.

also on the bill. Janis died in LA on this night. The FM tape of Truckin 
breaks off as a DJ's talk cuts in and generally does not circulate with 
the rest of the tape. Set 2 is a 10 minute SBD fragment; it cuts in on a 
jam involving the Dead and members of Airplane (Jack & Jorma are 
plainly audible), QMS (Cipollina is plainly audible) and Santana, and 
cuts out after ten minutes with the jam apparently still in progress. This 
tape comes from the audio track of a video in circulation; the cuts are 
on the video as well. There is also about 2:30 of 'interview' between a 
KSAN DJ and Pigpen, who injured his fingers playing tambourine 
because the crew didn't manage to bring his organ along to the gig. 
This video tape (and audio dubs from it) also includes Hard To Handle 
and China Cat › Rider. There ought to be more complete audio and 
video tapes around but so far they have not emerged into circulation.

was no acoustic set (besides Winterland, San Francisco, California 
10/4&5 this is the first full Dead show in several months without one). 
Before Truckin Bobby says "Marmaduke stayed home. There's no New 
Riders tonight. This is the economy package." The Other One sequence 
is unual in that they don't go back into Cryptical but take it right up to 
that point and then transit into NFA drums instead. Fragments of the 
Goin' Down The Road theme show up as early as 3:30 into the first 
NFA but even after it is fully stated they never sing the lyrics. Set 2 is 
the beginning of the second electric set. According to DeadBase IX

Cumberland Blues; Uncle John's Band. There is no SBD of this show

The beginning of Dark Star is cut on this tape; probably 2-4 minutes

cuts, which are likely on the master. This is B-grade audience tape -listenable

in the vault. The SBDs in circulation are copies from a master run from 
the venue's mixing board by their sound crew. There are circulating

Show NRPS set with Garcia, pedal steel, the complete set except the 
clipped conclusion of Honkytonk (likely the master includes this 
unlopped). SET 2 is the Early Show electric Dead set. The last minute 
or so of Rider is clipped; this sounds like it's on the master. There is 
also a brief cut starting 2:13 into Brokedown. This is the final Viola 
Lee Blues and Jerry slips out the backdoor without a goodbye. Hmm.

Comments: Total time 1:53:12 +. SET 1 is the conclusion of a NRPS 
set with Garcia, pedal steel. SET 2 is electric Dead. This is the deep 
space Dark Star of the year. Pigpen plays harmonica on Goin Down 
The Road. TAPES OF 11/5/70 The circulating AUD tapes from this 
show (2/98) consist of a 45-minute cassette side and a 100-minute 
cassette. The 45-minute side contains the 2 NRPS tunes and the 
beginning of the electric set through the post-drums Other One, which 
breaks off with the end of the side after 2:24. The 100-minute cassette's 
Side A runs smooth from the beginning of Truckin' through 3:31 into 
the post-drums Other One where there is a break in the tape in which 
probably 20-40 seconds is lost. Side A runs smooth again from here 
through the first 15 seconds of the pre-NFA drums, where it fades 
down (at 46:56 into the side). Side B backs up to the last notes of 
Stephen and restarts the pre-NFA drums, and runs for 5:17 more before 
cutting off at 32 seconds into GDTRFB, where it appears to lose 40 
seconds or less before resuming GDTRFB. There is no SBD master of 
this show in the vault. Both these tapes seem to be from the same mics 
but the pattern of cuts is hard to reconcile with any one set of standard 
length master sides. Probably there was more than one deck running 
off these mics, and with good reason --this is an excellent job of AUD 
taping. The missing first side of the 45-minute cassette master must 
contain the beginning of the NRPS set (the two songs in circulation 
conclude the set; another 45 minutes just about makes a NRPS set). 
And there must be another cassette for the acoustic set (also missing 
2/98). Very likely the rest of the Lovelight is on the master, probably 
another minute or two. THE CAPITOL THEATER SHOWS --NOV 
5-8 1970 For this run of shows at the Capitol Theater (Nov. 5-8) the 
Dead played a single concert each night on Thursday and Sunday, and 
an Early Show and a Late Show on Friday and on Saturday. The 
Capitol Theater's Village Voice ad for October 1 lists shows 
("featurning NRPS") at 8:00 PM on November 5th, 6th, 7th & 8th -i.
e. the Late Shows were not advertised; more curiously, there's no 
further mention of these shows at all in the the Capitol's Voice ads for 
10/29 and 11/5, while ads for the shows at the 46th St. Rock Palace in 
Brooklyn are prominent in these same issues. On Thursday and 
Sunday the show consisted of an acoustic Dead set, a NRPS set, and an 
electric Dead set. On Friday and Saturday, the Late Shows consisted of 
this same format, except that on Saturday they added a second electric 
set. We have tape of a Friday Early Show electric set, and DeadBase 
IX gives a list for a Saturday Early Show electric set (but no tape has 
surfaced yet). Perhaps this single electric set was the extent of these 
Early Shows, as in March at this venue, or perhaps the Early Shows too 
consisted of the full 3-part mini-set show, as apparently was the case at 
the Capitol in June.

[0:30]% 
Comments: Late Show total time 1:30:55 +. Total time Early & Late 
Shows 2:49:49 +. SET 1 is the opening 7 tunes of the Late Show 
acoustic Dead set; according to DeadBase IX it concluded with 
Brokedown Palace. This was followed by a NRPS set, but no tape has 
surfaced yet (2/98). SET 2 is the Late Show electric Dead set. The first 
3:10of the jam after Alligator is just Jerry & the drummers; this jam 
involves allusions to Not Fade Away, Goin Down The Road, The 
Other One and Caution, but never settles into any steady riff despite 
the drummers energetic efforts to herd it into Not Fade from 7:30 on -when 
they finally do slip into it by the back door at 10:39 the effect is 
explosive. The dovetail into Goin Down The Road 3 minutes later is as 
deft; this song features the additional verse "Mama told me son don't 
go down there." There are Caution hints in the transition from 
Mountain jam back to Not Fade. Pigpen's harmonica is prominent early 
in Caution --the jamming here is over the top, more than a match for 
any show ever --the segue into Lovelight takes it from a roar to a 
whisper to a roar in 3 seconds. It's hard to believe they didn't play an 
encore, or two. There is no SBD master of this show in the vault.

I Know You Rider. There is no tape of this set in circulation or in the 
vault; the basis of DeadBase's list is entirely unclear (as always). See 
Comments: under 11/05/70 on the structure of these shows. Set 1 is the 
Saturday Late Show acoustic Dead set. Set 2 is the Saturday Late Show 
NRPS set; it may be missing a tune or two before Truck Drivin Man, 
or this may be the complete set. The Sweet Lovin One false start 
occurs because Jerry's pedal steel guitar loses sound. Set 3 is the 
Saturday Late Show first electric set. After Casey Jones to end the set

that?" See 11/7/70b for the Saturday Late Show second electric set and

Comments: SET 1 is the Saturday Late Show second electric set. Late 
Show total time 3:00:57 +. There are no tapes from the Saturday Early 
Show presently circulating (2/98). The Saturday Late Show tapes 
appear to be complete, with the possible exception of the beginning of 
the NRPS set, and perhaps a final encore. Only one AUD master from 
this show seems to circulate. It was recorded by Jack Toner. There is a 
LOT of audience noise on this tape. The electric sets are better on the 
whole; the mics may have been moved. This is probably the weakest 
job of taping among the four nights of this run, but it is still very 
listenable (though the audience requires patience). This master 
circulates in two versions, a lower generation copy and a higher. The 
lower gen copy has 47 seconds cut from The Other One starting at 
5:56, it is missing King Bee & Good Lovin and is clipped at the 
beginnings and ends of many songs; these defects can be supplied from 
the higher gen copy. The higher gen copy has 3:30 cut out of the drums 
in The Other One. The timing of The Other One given here represents 
a composite. Few copies of these tapes include the NRPS songs and 
most are incomplete in other ways. There is no SBD master of 
Grateful Dead from this show in the vault.

Comments: Total time 3:38:49 +. SET 1 is acoustic Dead; timings 
from the 1st AUD master (1AUD). SET 2 is NRPS with Garcia, pedal 
steel; timings from 1AUD. SET 3 is electric Dead; timings are from the 
3rd AUD master (3AUD) through Casey Jones, thereafter 1AUD 
supplemented with 2AUD. There is a Main Ten jam in Dark Star from 
16:03 to 20:30. GDTRFB has additional lyrics ("Mama told me son 
don't go down there ..."); there is a brief Mountain jam starting around 
5:10of GDTRFB. Since no SBD survives in the vault of this alltime 
classic show we are especially lucky that there are three AUD masters 
in circulation. The best master as far as sound, reportedly 1AUD was 
recorded from the balcony. It is recognizable by the following defects: 
it is missing the opening 1:46 of Morning Dew, the 1st 9 seconds of 
Grateful Dead live performances 1959 – 1995 

-75



Around & Around, 1:02 of jamming in Baby Blue starting at 7:37, the 
first 3 seconds of Truckin, the first couple seconds of Dark Star, and 

4:19of jamming from Dancin, starting at 2:06. Some copies in 
circulation patch the beginning of Morning Dew with 2AUD; some 
patch the middle of Dancin with 2AUD, and of these some return to 
1AUD for the last 3:56 of Dancin and others continue with 2AUD 
through to the end of the song. Also, many circulating tapes that start 
with 1AUD and patch through to the end with 2AUD continue through 
to the end of the show with 2AUD's version of the concluding 
sequence, NFA through Good Lovin, despite the fact that 2AUD's 
GDTRFB is missing fully 3 minutes of jamming starting at 4:12. 
Besides this cut, which includes the brief Mountain jam, the 2AUD 
master of this sequence is distinguished by a woman saying "hey, 
more" during the opening NFA drums. 2AUD has more audience noise 
than 1AUD; it was probably made on the floor from some ways back; 
it is not widely circulated except fragmentarily as patches in Dew and 
Dancin on copies of 1AUD, but the complete acoustic set and all of the 
electric set except New Orleans › Searchin and Truckin through Dancin 
can be found; there is no sign of the NRPS set in 2AUD. Clearly on 
several occasions people have taken partial or complete versions of 
1AUD and 2AUD and assembled various combinations of the two 
tapes to make more nearly complete versions of the show --other 
combinations besides those noted above. 3AUD has only recently 
come into circulation. It was made on a Sony dictaphone; its sound 
quality improves as it progresses; probably the mic was moved closer 
to the PA in the course of the performance. 3AUD contains only the 
electric set; it is the only master that includes the opening 3 seconds of 
Truckin and the first bar of NFA; it is missing 0:47 of Good Lovin 
starting 5:40 after drums [4:07]. Most circulating copies of 1AUD 
require speed correction, whereas copies of 3AUD are more likely to 
be good speed. There is also SBD in circulation of the last 5 NRPS 
tunes, although there is no SBD of the Dead portions of this show in 
the vault or in circulation. On the best AUD master right before Casey 
Jones a guy near the mic (the taper?) says "It's going to be a night full 
of surprises" and a woman says back "really!" like she knows it & she's 
stoked to the max. I'd love to meet her.

also a NRPS set. There is a brief St. Stephen jam starting 7:30 into 
Hard To Handle. Early in jam1 there are references to Hey Bo Diddley 
and Who Do You Love; around 3:20 Jerry riffs on Nobody's Fault in 
quadruple time. Around 6:30 into this jam a riff resembling Tequila 
shows up, anticipating jam2, which returns to this figure several times. 
There is a break in the tape 41 seconds after the last drums but fair 
continuity in the jam; 20-40 seconds at most are lost in this lacuna. 
The first 110 minutes of the recording are not too bad; thereafter the 
sound quality deteriorates severely (the 2nd 90-minute tape starts with 
drums › Good Lovin). Reportedly, the master was made by one Mike 
Tannenbaum on reels concealed in a wheelchair at the center of the 5th 
row (the back of the orchestra pit?); the first 90 minutes of the tape 
sound consistent with this; during the 2nd tape it sounds as if the taper 
perhaps got swarmed when the crowd got up & thereafter his mics 
were muffled by surrounding bodies, but there are also other problems 
with the second 90 minutes of this tape, among them pitch problems 
perhaps caused by the deck bouncing with the dancing floorboards. 
Whatever the cause, the quality of reproduction on the 2nd tape of this 
set is piss poor.

Encore: Uncle John's Band [6:05] 
Comments: Total time 2:46:56 +. All the pauses between songs have 
been deleted from the circulating tapes, perhaps in the course of 
transferring from reels to cassettes. On the circulating cassettes the 
Good Lovin sequence is placed last, after Uncle John's Band on the 
second half of side B of the second 90-minute cassette. Plainly it 
doesn't belong there and must go somewhere before Truckin. Possibly 
it belongs after Candyman to close a first set, with Truckin through 
Casey Jones a second set and SET 2 a third --the evidence presently 
available leaves this entirely uncertain --indeed, as far as the evidence 
goes, the Good Lovin sequence could fall nearly anywhere before 
Truckin. However, the arrangement given here seemsthe likeliest. 
After Casey Jones Jerry says "We're gonna take a little break." Jorma 
Kaukonen plays throughout SET 2. The instrumental following All 
Over Now is his. Jack Casady joins on bass starting with jam1 and 
continue through the end of jam3.

Comments:. This show was a Hells Angels Benefit. There was also a 
NRPS set. In the pause before Mama Tried Bobby sings Logger Song 
off mic. Will Scarlet plays harmonica on Truckin › The Other One. 
Winwood sits in on organ on Hard To Handle, Big RR and Not Fade › 
Goin Down › Not Fade. The harmonica on Big RR Blues may not be 
Pigpen. Ramblin' Jack takes the first vocals on Not Fade Away and is 
audible intermittantly throughout the following sequence. Uncle John's 
Band has a brief prelude jam with someone on harmonica (again, it 
doesn't really sound like Pigpen). Uncle John's sounds like an encore; 
Bobby says "See y'all later" afterward. DeadBase IX is probably 
mistaken in saying the show concluded with Lovelight. These tapes are 
so cut up and scrambled that it's impossible to tell whether this is the 
complete show or not. It could be, the NRPS set aside, but more likely 
isn't. According to Chip Crossland in The East Village Other (vol. 1 no 
1 p. 10-11 Bobby sang Cathy's Clown at one point, perhaps with 
NRPS. According to DeadBase IX Capaldi & Wood also participated. 
This tape has been in circulation as long as any live Dead bootleg SBD 
--thank the Hells Angels --black sheep, maybe, but family. The tape 
in common circulation is missing China Cat Sunflower and has its song 
sequence completely disordered. There is also a 24 minute very lo gen 
SBD tape containing Mama Tried, Truckin › Other One, and Uncle 
John. Traffic's set from Fillmore East 11/23/70 45 SBD is also in

Comments: Total time 2:44:00 +. SET 1 is NRPS with Garcia, pedal 
steel. Besides the stub-end of Louisiana Lady and the clips between 
songs this appears to be the complete set. The circulating tape labels 
of this show lay out Don't Ease through Casey Jones as a first electric 
Dead set (total time 1:12:42 +) and Dire Wolf through Not Fade Away 
as a second electric Dead set (total time 42:45 +); DeadBase IX 
follows this layout). However, the tape in circulation splices directly to 
Dire Wolf after Casey Jones and there is no other evidence on the tape 
that there was a second electric set. If in fact a second electric Dead set 
does commence after Casey Jones, then it is probable that tunes are

missing before and/or after Dire Wolf. However, on the whole it seems 
likelier that this concert consisted of a single NRPS set followed by a 
single long electric Dead set. SET 2 is this single long electric Dead 
set, complete except for clips between songs, a cut in Dew at 7:17, a 
cut in the jam out of Truckin at 6:52, a very brief cut (probably a dropout) 
at 12:29 into The Other One, and two cuts in the Not Fade Away 
sequence. It's possible the opening drums of Good Lovin have been 
clipped on the circulating tape but this Good Lovin doesn't have a 
drum duo in the usual place either --the drummers start one their duo 
at the regular spot (2:04) but Jerry just keeps on jamming and after a 
few seconds the rest of the band kicks in behind him too. This monster 
Good Lovin is also interesting for the way it anticipates the Pigpen rap 
versions of '71. The tape cuts just as they are going into the Goin 
Down The Road theme at 5:00, and resumes seven seconds later during 
the final vocals of this tune, passing into the Bid You jam that usually 
concludes the tune within about a minute --that is, we are missing 
most of the song, several minutes at the least. After just 29 seconds of 
Not Fade reprise jamming, Jerry takes this into a unique little jam that 
lasts for 51 seconds and then shifts back to Not Fade. The tape cuts for 
good 1:20 later, during the beginning of the Not Fade vocals reprise. 
Altogether we must be missing at least 5-6 minutes from this sequence. 
This is a high energy show in many respects. Jerry seems unusually 
keyed up. It's not too bad a job of AUD taping, either, though not 
optimal by any means. The mics probably moved closer to the PA 
between the NRPS and electric sets. Thereafter the mics sound like 
they're not too far back in the hall --they are fairly well-saturated but 
there's still some hall resonance and bass boom; audience noise isn't 
too bad.

Comments: Total time 1:19:01 +. There are two tapes in the vault 
from Santa Rosa, December 1970 --a 41 minute reel marked 
"12/11/70" (listed here as SET 1) and an 80 minute tape marked 
"12/12/70" (listed here as SET 2). However, it is thought that there was 
only one Santa Rosa December 70 show, on the 12th, and that the vault 
tape marked the 11th is mislabeled. The tape listed as SET 1 is in 
circulation complete, often labeled "12/11/70," and sometimes 
"12/12/70." Only the last 38:05 minutes of the 80 minute tape listed in 
SET 2 presently circulate. Assuming both tapes come from a single 
concert on 12/12/70, obviously SET 2 is the show's conclusion, but it 
still isn't clear whether these tapes come from two sets or one. There 
was also a NRPS set and it's possible the entire concert consisted of a 
NRPS set followed by a single long electric Dead set, as at Columbus 
11/29/70. If so, then Big RR might well continue directly after Rider. If 
SET 1 comes from the first of two electric Dead sets then it is probably 
not complete. Me & My Uncle could be the first tune or we could be 
missing several tunes before it. The tape makes it clear that the set 
continued after I Know You Rider (the band is tuning as it breaks off). 
SET 2 appears to be all one set; reportedly there is no break after Casey 
Jones.

Comments: This is Crosby, Garcia, Lesh & Hart, sometimes known as 
David And The Dorks. SET 1 is tape of the band in performance; it 
may be a complete set. SET 2 is part of a soundcheck or rehearsal, 
almost certainly a tape run by the band for work purposes (as we know 
was Jerry's practice); reportedly there is a 49 minute version of this 
rehearsal tape also in circulation, but unexamined at this writing. 
DeadBase IX lists gigs by these musicians at the Matrix on December 
15, 16 & 17, billed as "Jerry Garcia & Friends." In the pause after the 
snatch of Eight Miles High vocals rehearsal (in SET 2) Crosby is heard 
asking someone to "put limiters on it. I overblew their mics last night." 
The comment implies he's talking on the second night of the run. The 
rehearsal fragment always occurs on circulating tape following the live 
set. If the master of this tape was a cassette run by the band of the 
concluding portion of one night's performance, with the next night's 
soundcheck-rehearsal started where the previous night left off, that 
would make SET 1 12/15/70 and SET 2 12/16/70. The tape has been 
variously dated from 12/15 to 12/24; DeadBase X lists SET 2 as 12/15. 
The first four tunes are all Crosby's. The jam out of Triad is choice -as 
is the entire live set, for that matter. Bertha is a very early version 
with a few bungled lyrics. Deep Elem is a unique arrangement heavily 
influenced by Crosby's rhythm guitar.

Comments: The New Riders, Hot Tuna and Stoneground were also on 
the bill, and the Dead closed the evening with one long set. Two 
separate tapes make up the circulating recordings from this show. 
Video of the concert was broadcast by KQED-TV San Francisco, 
California with the first 4 songs simulcast on KSAN-FM San 
Francisco, California. The tape of these tunes comes to us from the 
simulcast FM-SBD; on the circulating tape there is a cut in Monkey & 
The Engineer at around 1:00 and Easy Wind breaks off about 3 
minutes before its conclusion. According to DeadBase IX a Me And 
My Uncle followed Easy Wind; but if so there is no trace of it on 
circulating tape. The other tape in circulation is a pre-broadcast SBD 
from KQED-TV; it picks up with Big RR Blues. In the pause before 
Dire Wolf they tease Cryptical repeatedly. The Other One goes directly 
into Black Peter, entirely eliding the Cryptical Envelopment reprise 
and jam. In the interval between Sugar Mag and China Cat a taper in 
the audience is busted, with Phil directing a spotlight upon him. In the 
background of the China Cat › Rider that follows, but definitely on 
mic, there is a lady screaming out of control --she sounds very dosed, 
spun out hard, and at the moment not really having that much fun. She 
screws up the recording of China Cat › Rider pretty good and continues 
some in the pause that follows, where there's also a woman on mic 
looking for her cape --plainly things were a little out of control 
backstage; perhaps there was a mic live that shouldn't have been 
somewhere backstage or in the wings. The show-concluding Good 
Lovin › Uncle John's Band that follows is an alltime classic. It used to 
circulate as Side B of a cassette whose Side A contained the last 45 
minutes of Fillmore West, San Francisco, California 6/7/69, with the 
concluding Lovelight with Janis breaking off before the end, and 
sometimes this Good Lovin › Uncle John was erroneously labeled 
"6/7/69" (nearly 6 months before the tune's premier!). Where versions 
of Good Lovin earlier in the year have a passage of drums, here the 
drummers move to the foreground and Jerry and Phil take turns 
discreetly jamming with them for about 4 minutes before the whole 
band resumes jamming at full blast. And like the Good Lovins of 
11/29/70 and 12/28/70, this one anticipates the Pigpen rap arrangement 
of spring '71.

Comments: Billy is the sole drummer and Keith absent on this tape, 
which plainly dates it to March -August 1971. The performance 
strongly suggests March or April. This tape is definitely not 7/2/71 
rearranged.

Comments: (1) {Sugar Magnolia [4:40] pause [0:02] Sunshine 
Daydream [1:05]} * (2) {Good Lovin' [1:44] > Drums [4:07] > Good 
Lovin' [11:47]} Jim Powell says "These lists derive from the 120 
minutes of SBD now circulating from this show. These tapes are 
plainly incomplete and there was also a NRPS set. The tapes circulate 
in three pieces: a) a 45-minute side containing China Cat through 
Casey Jones and Morning Dew through Second That Emotion; b) a 45minute 
side containing Good Lovin through Uncle John; and c) a 30 
minute side comprising The Rub, King Bee, and Lovelight. China Cat 
through Casey Jones is the 1st set conclusion. The Rub clearly comes 
from earlier in the 1st set. Perhaps King Bee belongs here or --more 
likely --comes from the 2nd set. After Bertha there is a longish pause 
during which, among other shenanigans, Phil announces "Alright all 
you wise guys write your requests on your girlfriends' bosoms and send 
'em up here." The Set 2 list looks more nearly complete. !The tape of 
Second That Emotion breaks off; King Bee could come here. It is so 
difficult to decide where the 22:03 fragment of Lovelight which 
circulates labeled with this date could have fit in the show that it is 
tempting to conclude it does not actually belong to this date (its listing 
here under Set 3 does not mean to imply a 3rd set). It is certainly from 
this period (one drummer but some congas at the beginning, 
presumably from Pigpen)." Thayer Jennings says "Second That 
Emotion cuts off with a significant portion missing. Splice in Sing Me 
Back Home, with perhaps 8 seconds missing (accounted for in timing). 
Splice in Not Fade Away (#1), with approximately 4 seconds missing 
(accounted for in timing)." Dick Latvala says "4/25/71-Fillmore East: 
I have never seen a list on the 16 track tapes, and that is the only way 
the show exists." Jim Powell replies "I'm unclear what the later phrase 
means. It's possible that the King Bee and Rub are misattributed, 
because they came into circulation as filler on later shows from the run, 
but it's established they are different versions than any in circulation. 
And the Lovelight is a hint more dubiously dated 4/25/71, as the entry 
remarks. But I hear no reason to doubt the other 90 minutes of tape 
dated 4/25/71. Does Latvala mean to claim that the only tape of the 
show made was a 16-track? How could he even KNOW that --in view, 
e.g., of Alan Mande's tape of 5/15/70?"

Comments: Some copies of 8/6/71 have Sugaree before Morning 
Dew. Deadbase says it is probably from the previous night, but on 
Kevin Weil's tape there is no audible splice and the Sugaree is 
complete, unlike the 8/5/71 Sugaree. Jim Powell vaguely remembers 
some copies of 8/6 having mixed in songs from 8/5 but can't remember 
the exact details. The ciculating aud tape was probably recorded from 
up front on the floor --50' back --using two Sony ECM 220 mics with 
a Sony 770 open reel deck.

??/??/71 Unknown venue 
Set 1: Cryptical Envelopment > Drums > The Other One > Me And 
My Uncle > The Other One > Deal; Sugar Magnolia % Big Railroad 
Blues; Comes A Time 
Comments: This tape used to circulate labeled "Columbus 10/31/71" 
but the release of Dick's Picks Two and other information proves this 
incorrect. Clearly this tape comes from the last three months of 1971. It 
is definitely not 10/29/71. The Big RR, Comes A Time might well be 
filler from the 1st set and the rest of the tape from the 2nd set.

Encore: One More Saturday Night [#4:29] 
Comments: Notes regarding timings from SBD tape. First few notes 
of Tennessee Jed, China Cat Sunflower and El Paso are clipped. There 
is a splice in I Know You Rider; at 0:21 it cuts off and comes back in 
right away on cue before the "Lay down last night" verse. Two or three 
runs through the chorus are missing. Casey Jones comes in on the 
"High on cocaine," chorus before the first verse. (1) Good Lovin' 
[#6:33]> Mind Left Body Jam [1:41]> Good Lovin' [8:10] Fades in 30 
seconds before the first verse. There is a definite pause in the beat 
before MLBJ. Pigpen does rap a bit over it. Garcia is particularly 
rippin' from MLBJ on. *SNIT beginning clipped; first verse comes in 
after 9 seconds 
Recording: 135 AUD (complete show) and 90 SBD: The 1st 6 songs 
(Bertha through Next Time You See Me) are missing.

The quality of the tape varies, improving over the course of the show; 
it's possible the mics were moved between sets. This is a great show. 
False start on BT Wind. Garcia on pedal steel for LL Rain. Hard to 
distinguish the transition b/t China>Rider b/c of tape quality. After 
'Mexicali' Phil address the audience members who are fans of 
'Alligator,' "We just forgot it, dude."

Comments: The complete show is available in FM-SBD except 
Loser, Tennesse Jed, Big Boss Man, It Hurts Me Too, Brown Eyed 
Women, Looks Like Rain And Ramble On Rose. These are all 
available in excellent AUD. Brown Eyed Women appears on Europe 
72. The FM-SBD of this show is from a Danish broadcast And so 
without the compression that characterizes and limits the quality of 
American FM broadcasts; compare the FM-SBD of Berlin (10/20/90). 
The pedal steel on Looks Like Rain is wonderful. Final time Garcia 
played pedal steel live with the Dead until Dylan tour. (1) Dark Star

cut) > I Know You Rider (breaks off), Mexicali Blues, Loser, Playing 
In The Band (the last 3:49 only), and concludes with a fragment that 
cuts in on The Other One and ends with Goin Down The Road.[JP] 
There is NO "Caution" in the second set. Although there is a very long 
and beautiful jam out of "Truckin" the "Caution Theme" is never 
stated. This long jam is played for the most part without drums. "The 
Other One" Theme is strongly stated and jammed on before "Me & My 
Uncle" however no vocals are sung prior to, only the 1st verse of "The 
Other One" is sung after "Me & My Uncle". Lastly there is NO "Uncle 
Johns Band" played in this set!

He's Gone; It Hurts Me Too; Sugar Magnolia; Not Fade Away > Goin' 
Down The Road Feeling Bad > Not Fade Away 
Encore: One More Saturday Night 
Comments:\setlist from Berkeley site. Second set confirmed from 
vault sources. The Other One timing includes drums. The Big River 
doesn't seem to be on the multitracks, and isn't listed on a transcribed 
version of the seven inch reel two tracks. I was only able to audibly 
verify through most of the He's Gone, at which point the version I 
heard runs out. The rest of the list is based on the label from a 
transcription of the seven inch reels, where, according to the label, the 
He's Gone is complete but the GDTRFB is chopped and the concluding 
NFA does not appear. There were enough technical problems that it 
would be wise to verify this show's lists with audience tape. Both the 
multitracks and the two tracks from this show have problems. (I post 
this here mostly for the Other One timing, since I recall someone 
collecting those --and because we can independently verify that at 
least these songs appear to be correct, based on two different versions 
of the sbd recording from the show.)

Magnolia [4:38]; [0:10]; Sunshine Daydream [1:34] } (4) Sort of segue 
between Sugar Magnolia and Not Fade Away. Not Fade Away is 
started immediately by Lesh only as Sugar Magnolia ends. As he fades 
out after a few notes Weir then picks it up and then Keith and 
eventually the rest of the band.

only the first 120 minutes of the show (Promised Land through Ramble 
On Rose) and includes Bobby McGee and Me And My Uncle. The 
sound quality of this one is "merely horrid" as opposed to "definitively

Encore: One More Saturday Night 
Comments: The complete show except the beginning of El Paso and 
Saturday Night; the SBD breaks off in the middle of Comes A Time 
and the rest of the show, as well as the SBD's missing Greatest Story, 
is supplied by the AUD tape (whose sound quality leaves something to 
be desired). (1) Weir: We're experiencing another modernn miacle of 
the technical age. That being the occasional glimpse of a working 
piano over here. But about every 15 seconds we get plunged back into 
the dark ages where modern physical and electrical postulates, etc. no 
longerr apply. {pause} Ladies and gentlemen we've located the 
problem. Turn it up turn it up keith so they can hear it {awful noise}. 
That's it. Tiny little electrical mice gnawing their way through the 
pickups you see. We go a big elctronic cat after him. And we expect at 
any point now a swift and merciful end to their gnawing existence. 
You can while away the hours by turrnning to the guy next to you by 
hollering "Stand UP, Sit Down, Stand UP Sit Down" until he gets the 
point. Whatever that is. (2) China Cat Sunflower [3:45] > Jam [3:53] > 
I Know You Rider (3) Weir: We're gonna take a short break and fix the 
piano so that it really works and then we'll be back and we're gonna 
play for awhile. (4) Weir: You're going to have to enunciate more 
clearly. Alligator did you say Alligator? Everybody ready? Lesh: Yeah. 
Weir: I'd like to take the opportunity no to introduce Donna Jean here. 
Donna Jean: Thank You. Weir: She's gonna help us out with this next 
number and it goes something like this, 3,5,7,8,9,10. (5) Truckin'>Dark

version of WRS Prelude Weir: Well anyway ha ha what we're gonna 
do next is history. (7) Before Truckin' Weir: This is something we 
should've done a couple of minutes ago but we're gonna do it now 
instead. Weir: This is why they call us a boogie band. 1,2..1,2 (8) Bass

little hepatitis when we went to Europe and that combined with his

Comments: The complete show on SBD. An AUD supplies the 1st set 
and El Paso through the fragmentary Saturday Night. The AUD tape is 
excellent. 
Recording: 200 SBD, partial AUD. Timed from AUD with 
insignificant splices in Truckin' And Drums. Stella Blue is complete 
but near its end the tape speeds up to a point making an accurate time 
impossible.

Comments: The SBD tape contains Playing In The Band (15:50 with a

You Rider (breaks off at 4:02) And Sugar Magnolia. The aud contains 
the 1st 4 songs of the 2nd set (Greatest Story> Bertha> The Promised 
Land, Friend Of The Devil) in fairly listenable quality; this tape is very 
rare but its existence suggests that rumors of a complete AUD of the 
show are true (it'd be nice to patch the Rider from it).

Comments: The sound setup at this show was the first version of the 
Wall of Sound. Sound mixing problems at the board during Promised 
Land. According to reports from an eyewitness, this was the result of 
half the speakers frying. Very brief splice during Looks Like Rain. 
Complete Loose Lucy timing supercedes previous listing showing it 
cut at 4:59. Splice in Playing In The Band at 8:38. Hard to tell how 
much is missing although it can't be more than a few minutes and could 
be only a few seconds. Splice in Truckin' at 6:23. Could be a minute 
or two missing here. The first Eyes has quite a bit of exploratory 
jamming without dropping to that Dm riff (or whatever you want to 
call it), which is present to some degree in all other known '73 versions 
of the song. Jerry plays the chord on the final notes of the song before 
changing to China Doll. By February 15, the change had been worked 
out. The cut in Wave That Flag at 1:25 is missing a full chorus a after 
the second verse. Before Sugar Magnolia, Bob says, " This one's our 
new single, broke big as hell in Pittsburgh...that's the truth, too." 
During Casey Jones, a blown amplifier is audible in the mix. {Playing 
In The Band [3:05] > Jam [13:#29] > Playing In The Band [2:25]} The 
show has the first performances of Loose Lucy, Here Comes Sunshine, 
They Love Each Other, Eyes Of The World, China Doll and Wave 
That Flag. Tape flips following Looks Like Rain, Here Comes 
Sunshine, They Love Each Other, and Ramble On Rose. The 
following song begins, cuts and is restarted on the next side. This is a 
solid and energetic show, with each song getting as full a performance 
as possible. A slew of new songs performed as though they had been 
performed for years, particularly songs that would grow into staples of 
sets.

Comments: {Dark Star 0:00 > First Verse 16:55 to 18:10 > end 24:45} 
Information based on Vault Tape. The superior AF master supplies the 
1st set. There is a brief cut in Mexicali. The tape breaks off during I 
Know You Rider after "Wish I was a headlight" and resumes during 
Looks Like Rain before "Did you ever listen to the sound." China Cat 
Sunflower through Looks Like Rain circulates separately in the inferior 
AF to cover this cut (Bobby's guitar is very prominent on this master). 
At the end of the first set on the superior AF tape is spliced in They 
Love Each Other from the inferior AF; this breaks off half way. The 
SB in circulation runs from Dark Star through Not Fade Away. There 
is a cut during the Jam before the second vocals of Eyes Of The World. 
Most copies of the SBD in circulation are somewhat fast. 
Recording: 80 SBD: Dark Star through final NFA except Me And My 
Uncle; 85 FOB 25 FOB. (8/97)

Encore: And We Bid You Good Night 
Comments: This is a three-beat Beat It On Down The Line. There's a 
source/gen change of the tape during the coda of He's Gone. At about 

7:30of the China Cat, Phil is making a determined effort to steer the 
jam that would finally emerge in it's full form on March 16. 
Recording: 135 SBD: The complete show except Truckin, Morning 
Dew, Sugar Magnolia & And We Bid You Good Night. The 1st set & 
2nd set opening SBD circulating is somewhat degraded. (4/97)

They Love Each Other, Mexicali Blues, Playin' In The Band, Row 
Jimmy, Beat It On Down The Line, Here Comes Sunshine (breaks off), 
Truckin' > Nobody's Jam > The Other One > Eyes Of The World

Encore: One More Saturday Night 
Comments: "Take A Step Back" before Wave That Flag. The ends of 
The Race Is On and Wave That Flag are cut. At 3;25 into I Know You 
Rider, there is a source change to a copy from an improved master. 
The edit is well done. Phil teases Cumberland Blues before Half-Step. 
There are segues between Half-step, Stella Blue, and Jack Straw. 
Some equipment problems delay the start of Truckin'. There's a 
marginally insignificant splice at 6:45 of The Other One. DB IX lists 
Casey Jones as Encore One, One More Saturday Night as Encore Two. 
Bob says "Thank you, good night", following Johnny B. Goode. On 
the tape however there is only 34 seconds between Johnny B. Goode 
and Casey Jones and there is no cut. My conclusion is that the band 
decided to forego leaving the stage and just played another song, 
followed by the actual encore, which is how the listing is presented 
here. 
Recording: 130 AUD + 110 SBD: The complete show, the 1st set & 
encore in listenable AUD, the 2nd set in SBD. On the AUD used for 
timings, there is no One More Saturday Night. There were at least two 
masters made. The first master which was used for these timings is 
quite listenable. The master used to fill in the end of I Know You 
Rider is very good.

Encore: One More Saturday Night; Casey Jones [6:22] 
Comments: On the AUD source, Weir says "goodnight everybody" 
following Casey Jones, but it remains uncertain whether One More 
Saturday Night or Casey Jones or either was an encore, as listed in 
DBIX. Phil makes some fire aisle clearing Comments: after Jack 
Straw. "Take A Step Back" and a Merry Go Round tuning follow Big 
River. 
Recording: 255 SBD + 235 AUD: The complete show in SBD except 
China Cat Sunflower through Here Comes Sunshine, which is supplied 
by an excellent AUD. Soundboard tape is from 7" Reel of Betty's

missing Sugar Magnolia and One More Saturday Night.

All the between song spaces have splices on the AUD tape, making it 
impossible to be certain what the actual setlist is. The flow isn't 
interrupted too much, but it seems apparent that this show had quite 
long gaps between songs along the vein of May 26. Turning up the 
complete AUD would be nice. This is a 6-beat Beat It On Down The 
Line. There's cut before the "queen of diamonds" verse during Loser, 
with about 15 seconds missing. Prior to Don't East Me In, Phil 
announces a bring-your-own, pro-legalization "smoke-in" at the 
Hartford Capitol in April. Analog tape flips come after They Love 
Each Other, 
Recording: 210 AUD + SBD: The complete show except the 
beginning of Cumberland Blues circulates in excellent AUD. A SBD 
of the last 75 
minutes of the show, Weather Report Suite Prelude through Johnny B. 
Goode, also circulates, but it is marred by a steady hum.

Comments: The current second set cassette begins with Big River. It 
is unclear from the AUD tape in circulation what the actual conclusion 
of the first set and start of the second set is. If DBIX's list is correct 
then perhaps the first set concludes with China Doll. With the current 
list, the second set times just a little over an hour. While there are a 
few short second sets during this fall, none of them are as energetic as 
this show. At 5:05 of Truckin, there is a tape flip where perhaps as 
much as 30-45 seconds are missing. At 10:39 of Truckin, there's 
another cut, leaving a lengthy gap in the tape. Truckin resumes with 
the last 24 seconds, the song trailing to a conclusion. 
Recording: 180 AUD: The complete show except the end of Not Fade 
Away & the encores, in marginally listenable AUD. He's Gone through 
Not Fade Away is also available in SBD. (4/97)

9/18/73 Onondaga County War Memorial, Syracuse, New York 
Comments: A 30min SBD tape labeled with this date contains: 
Truckin' [9:21] > Nobody's Fault But Mine Jam [2:21] > Jam [0:38] > 
Eyes Of The World [15:51#]. The entire segment includes Martin 
Fierro and Joe Ellis and is unique to the other shows with this song 
sequence. An eyewitness to the 17th claims that the show originally 
scheduled for the 18th was cancelled due to lack of ticket sales. Show 
not in circulation.

Comments: There are tapes in circulation that have Around And 
Around spliced to the beginning of the first set tape as well as starting 
the second set. From the cut and the general ambient sound between 
Around and Promised land on the first set version, it seems clear that 
this is not the correct start. The list has been changed to reflect this 
information until further confirmation is received. 
Recording: 180 SBD: The complete show except The Promised Land, 
the beginning of Sugaree and the conclusions of Playing In The Band 
and Let It Grow. (2/98)

Set 1: Bertha; El Paso; Deal; They Love Each Other; Greatest Story

Set 2: Here Comes Sunshine; Big River; Dark Star [43:05] > Eyes Of 
The World [13:49] > Stella Blue [8:31]; Sugar Magnolia [9:25] 
Comments: Show [3:05:00] Information based on vault tape. {Dark 
Star 0:00 > First Verse 24:45 to 26:00 > end 43:05}. According to an 
eyewitness to the show and someone local to the area, the venue for 
this show is actually Public Hall, the same place as the 10/28/72 show. 
Apparently, the confusion comes from the fact that the Public Hall, 
Music Hall and the Convention Center are all on the same block. Of 
side interest is the report that a woman jumped on the stage during 
Sugar Magnolia to dance in front of Bob. 
Recording: 100 SBD: From the 1st set, They Love Each Other, 
Greatest Story, China Cat > Rider, from the 2nd Dark Star > Eyes Of 
The World (with a cut) > Stella Blue, in SBD. A very good AUD also 
circulates, containing the end of Here Comes Sunshine, Big River, and 
Dark Star through Sugar Magnolia (the Eyes uncut and the Dark Star 
with [1:06] more initial tuning space Jam cut from the SBD. There is 
also an FM-SBD circulating, with even more of the Dark Star opening 
clipped (4/97). A 140 AUD with this date contains the following songs 
from set one, in this order: Black Throated Wind, Greatest Story Ever 
Told, Around And Around. The latter appears to be the correct first set 
conclusion. The second set is about 100min and contains, in this order: 
Here Comes Sunshine, Big River, Dark Star> Eyes Of The World> 
Stella Blue> Sugar Magnolia (3/98).

Comments: {Dark Star 0:00 > Mind Left Body 7:30 > Dark Star 9:20 
> First Verse 10:50 to 12:40 > drums 20:55 > end 22:55}They take 
short break to fix the piano after Bobby McGee, followed by a cut in 
the tape. It cuts back in near the end of a Bobby story. There is a cut 
at 3:01 into I Know You Rider just after the second "headlight" verse, 
picking up in the middle of the following chorus. The first set cassette 
flips after the 14-beat Beat It On Down The Line. This tape ends after 
Bertha. The second tape resumes the second set and flips near the end 
of Dark Star. Splice at 3:03 of Wharf Rat after "I'm sure she's been 
true to you", continues during "wandered downtown". 
Recording: 200 SBD; 180 AUD: There are at least 3 masters in 
existence. The SBD is virtually complete except for very brief dropouts 
during I Know You Rider and Wharf Rat. There is also a spectacular 
AUD, which was actually made by the band with mics on stage; this 
tape is missing Tennessee Jed & Me And Bobby McGee. There is also 
at least one AUD master made from the audience in circulation.

in completely scrambled sequence (if DB's order is correct, as it 
probably is).

Encore: Uncle John's Band [8:26] 
Comments: (1) Terrapin Station [11:15] > At a Siding [3:38] 
Recording: AUD 180, Good Lovin' circulates, it's omission is 
particular to mylineage. Timings from both sources. A SBD 120 
circulates on DAT of Half-Step, All Over Now, Sugaree, Minglewood, 
Cassidy, Scarlet > Fire, Estimated, Terrapin, Not Fade Away > 
Stephen > Around & Around. A second SBD missing Promised Land, 
Half-Step, and Ship Of Fools. Originally I gave the Not Fade Away 
song timing as [19:#51] with an insignificant tape flip-a timing which 
came from an audience recording. Reportedly a SBD circulates with a 
considerably longer splice-[1:05] in duration, however, when I 
listened to the SBD 120 on DAT I heard no splices whatsoever, so, 
either I was fooled and Not Fade Away is really [20:34], or the 
audience tape included an overlap between the A and B sides and 
therefore there are at least two different SBD recordings in circulation, 
one with a complete Not Fade Away, one without.

Comments: No encore. (1) Dancing In The Street is not reprised at the 
end. There has been debate as to the correct length of Eyes Of The 
World ([11:38] or [12:26] as now shown here). The CD distributed by 
the original taper, Teddy “Goodbear” attests that the 12:26 time is, in 
fact, the correct timing. There is what sounds like a minor splice in 
Stella Blue. 
Recording: AUD 150 with the beginning of Bertha clipped and minor 
cuts in Tennessee Jed.

it's complete running time to be 10:52. Lazy Lightnin' is completely 
omitted, Supplication is missing except for the final 1:39. Friend Of 
The Devil is dubbed in from A SBD. Due to the lack of any circulating 
SBD for this show I do raise the possibility of whether or not the 
Friend Of The Devil is from the same show, perhaps someone with a 
different AUD can verify? On some versions Around & Around cuts 
off at 3:00 and Uncle John’s Band is missing entirely.

Encore: U.S. Blues [5:25] 
Recording: FM broadcast 180. Missing Samson And Delilah, cut in 
Goin' Down The Road Feeling Bad is horrific and of considerable 
duration. There are copies circulating with both songs intact, however 
there is a siginificant level drop In Goin' Down The Road Feelin' Bad. 
This level drop may originate from the initial broadcast.

Sugar Magnolia [8:52] 
Encore: Uncle John's Band [8:21] 
Comments: (1) Saint Stephen not finished. (2) Iko Iko is sung as part 
of Not Fade Away-no transition exists between songs and one could 
argue NFA is 12:51 with lyrics to Iko Iko sung at the beginning (much 
like Who Do You Love appeared in versions of Caution in 1972). 
Recording: SBD 180 and AUD 180. Set one timings from SBD with 
beginning of Lazy Lightnin' missing about 45-60 seconds, though 
some copies do have this song intact. Dancing In The Street cuts off 
during the end vocals. It is impossible to determine the approximate 
amount missing-could be twenty seconds or five minutes. Set two 
timings from an AUD.

When was that show? 
Once upon a time it was believed without question that the Grateful 
Dead appeared in Tuscaloosa, Alabama on May 17th and at the Fox 
Theatre in Atlanta on May 18th and 19th. But alas, one fine day a well-
meaning fan produced a ticket stub for Tuscaloosa dated the 18th of 
April. A massive investigation followed and numerous individuals, too 
many to mention really, worked long and hard to learn that the 
Tuscaloosa concert was in fact originally scheduled for April 18th and 
tickets were sold bearing that date. For reasons not determined the 
concert was rescheduled for May 17th. The best guess why is that the 
17th of May was simply more convenient for the band’s schedule. But 
to further complicate this issue, there has been an unsubstantiated 
claim that the Dead also appeared in Tuscaloosa on the 18th and not 
Atlanta. However, ticket stubs bearing the date May 18th Fox Theatre, 
Atlanta, GA have been produced. At this point I would like to put this 
issue to bed for eternity everlasting. I believe it can be stated without 
challenge that the Dead played Tuscaloosa, Alabama on May 17th, 
1977 and at the Fox Theatre, Atlanta, Georgia on May 18th and 19th, 
1977. There is no question as to the veracity of these facts.

Recording: AUD 180 multiple masters. Each set timed from different 
AUD sources. Cut in Friend Of The Devil is sizeable. Johnny B. 
Goode cuts off with about one minute missing. Cut in Drums seems to 
be a minor tape flip.

relatively minor tape flips, cutting off of The Music Never Stopped is 
criminal and likely on the master. Playing In The Band Reprise cutoff 
is probably less than a minute. I have not seen an AUD of this show.

Recordings: First set SBD, second set AUD. Approximately 90 to 
120 seconds off the front of Bertha is missing on the SBD. The AUD 
has Sunrise cutting off as indicated. The original AUD master appears 
to have had the first three songs of the second set recorded on the first 
set tape with the cutoff of Sunrise presumably existing on the master. 
A fast tape flip splice occurs in Wharf Rat, however in subsequent 
dubs, with Wharf Rat moved further onto the B side, a slight overlap 
will occur-this has been deducted from the timing. The splice in the 
middle of PITB is indeterminable but probably insignificant.

Encore: U.S. Blues [5:33] 
Recordings: SBD 180, AUD 180. Timings from AUD. Very quick 
tape flips (about three seconds each) in Eyes Of The World and 
Around And Around. The SBD does not have a complete U.S. Blues. 
A 90 minute black & white video of the first set through part of Loser 
and from the second set: Truckin', Wharf Rat, and part of Around And 
Around circulates. The show was filmed by the university with three 
cameras (two between the front row and the stage, and one at the 
soundboard). The circulating segment is an edit from the three camera 
shots. There is no trace of the remaining portion of the show nor each 
of the three original reels. The films have reportedly long since 
disappeared from the Duke University archives. The video quality is a 
little rough but historic nonetheless as it is a rare document that has 
Garcia windmilling a la Pete Townsend.

Comments: (1) Phil and drummers 
Recordings: AUD 180. Cut at the end of Drums is of indeterminate 
duration. There is likely only one AUD master in existence. 
Correspondence with the taper (Robert Wagner) has revealed that the 
encore was not recorded-he had inserted a fresh tape but it jammed. 
He saw no other tapers at this show. Recording was made with Sony 
54Ps > Sony 158. Most circulating copies of the 7/1 and 7/3 shows 
originate from this same source.

forgotten. Cut in beginning of Around And Around, estimated 
complete time is 9:00. Though SBDs may exist for this show, many so-
called SBDs are in fact an excellent FOB audience tape.

Encore: U.S. Blues [5:17] 
Comments: (1) Phil, and briefly Jerry, play quietly during Drums. Phil 
is last heard at 5:#51 into the Drums. 
Recordings: AUD 180 multiple masters, none I've heard are 
particularly good. A 125 min SBD featuring part of set one and all of 
set two except Truckin’ circulates. Timings are from an AUD except 
for Scarlet > Fire. Splice in Drums likely an insignificant tape flip.

Encore: Johnny B. Goode [4:03] 
Comments: (1) A brief Mojo jam lasting under a minute begins at 
8:39. 
Recordings: AUD 180, SBD 180. Timed from both sources with 
heaviest reliance on an AUD. For The SBD, the first set and second set 
through 5:59 of Good Lovin' is high quality. The second tape is a 
somewhat degraded SBD that begins with Estimated Prophet. The 
Drums are completely obliterated, and there is a major splice between 
NFA and Black Peter omitting about four minutes from NFA and fifty 
seconds off the beginning of Black Peter. In the encore position of the 
SBDs is Casey Jones, however it is not from this show but is from 
12/19/78.

Hey, dude! You forgot some shows! Like, I have this ticket stub and, 
and, and… Whoa! Hold on there, buddy – psychedelic dreams have 
gotten the best of you and your memory ain’t what it used to be. On 
November 25th the band was set-up and ready to play a show at the 
New Haven Coliseum. Unfortunately there was this small matter of 
Jerry being really sick and having to go to the hospital. Subsequently, 
six shows were cancelled. The following is a list of the shows and their 
make-up dates. As all performances were rescheduled, tickets issued 
for any of the original shows were honored. There are thousands of 
stubs floating around bearing the cancelled dates. 

November 25 – New Haven Coliseum, New Haven, CT – 
rescheduled for January 17, 1979. 
November 27 – Spectrum, Philadelphia, PA – 
rescheduled for January 5, 1979. 
November 28 – Spectrum, Philadelphia, PA – 
rescheduled for January 12, 1979. 
November 30 – Madison Square Garden, New York, NY – 
rescheduled for January 7, 1979. 
December 1 – Madison Square Garden, New York, NY – 
rescheduled for January 8, 1979. 
December 2 – Utica Coliseum, Utica, NY – 
rescheduled for January 14, 1979.

reportedly exist. Splice in Drums is indeterminate but probably minor. 
Splice in Goin' Down The Road Feeling Bad is likely at least a minute. 
I have yet to see an AUD of this show, but I have confirmed that it was 
recorded.

Comments: Donna does not appear on any post-Drums songs. 
Recordings: AUD 200. At least two masters exist, one high quality 
AUD and one low quality AUD. The second set is in greater 
circulation than the first set and most copies originate from the better 
of the two masters. This master was recorded with Sony 54Ps into a 
Sony 158 cassette recorder by Robert Wagner who recorded all the 
shows from 12/12 through 12/19 with this rig. The cutting of Half-step 
Mississippi (the song begins at the end of the third verse) originates 
from his master and was the result of a tape jam. The splice in the 
Drums appears to be an insignificant tape flip. Assumedly a SBD 
exists as the encore appears in SBD form at the end of SBD tapes of 
11/21/78.

subsequent reformatting.

Comments: The list DeadBase provides is almost identical to a list

to me as having been played at this show approximately in the location 
given. Consult vault sources.

Comments: Assumed second set: Scarlet Begonias > Fire On The

Black Peter > Good Lovin'; encore: U.S. Blues. I have no reason to 
accept DeadBase's list as correct. By all accounts, a full stop occurs 
after Bertha, and it ends the first set. Consult vault sources. 
Recordings: SBD 90 as listed above, beginning of Don't Ease is 
clipped. The Bertha, at 3:34, is obscenely short. I could not detect a 
splice, however there may be a good edit job on it. No other recordings 
of this show circulate.

outstanding 11th row Nakamichi 550 master. A SBD reportedly exists 
which I am told has several harsh cuts/splices in it. This remains 
speculation as I have not confirmed this.

Comments: First set timed from an AUD, second set from a worthless 
SBD with the following cuts and splices: Estimated cuts off and seems 
to restart with the opening notes of He's Gone which has a splice of its 
own. A segment of the Drums has been cut out. A minor splice appears 
in The Other One. And finally, Good Lovin' cuts off. If that's not 
enough for you, the first set SBD has a minor (about 11 secs) splice in 
Bird Song and the first 30 seconds or so is missing from I Know You 
Rider. Some people should not be allowed near tapes.

Comments: (1) Gordon Sharpless Says ``The Piece I Have Titled 
"What The Fuck" [But Shown As "Jam" Here --John] (A Long 
Standing Title I Used In My Own Set List Books In The 80s) Is 31 
Seconds Of Incomprehensible Music, Founded In Bobby Trying To 
Sing Let It Grow (Sort Of) While The Remainder Of The Band Still 
Plays Supplication (Sort Of). The End Result Is 31 Seconds Of 
Something That Is Neither Supplication Nor Let It Grow, And Upon A 
Critical Listening, Can Be Only Titled "What The Fuck?!".''

Comments: (1) Only time played. There are two versions of this 
show. There's an FM version, and a Pre-FM as David let out the seed 
after he produced it for the air as a 2 CD set on the GDH trading list. 
The first set however does not exist in SBD source, it was a 
malfunctioned tape, or it malfunctioned later in it's life -or that's my 
recollection of Gan's reasoning for the Set II only. Andy L.

Appear Correct. Deadbase Notes A "Power Outage" During Promised. 
Very Small Portion Of Masterpiece Is Cut At The End, Approximately 
10 Seconds. Bruce Hornsby On Accordian During Jack Straw, And 
Probably Some Other Songs. Garcia Introduces Hornsby After Jack 
Straw. He Is Inaudible In The Mix Otherwise. Before "We Can Run," 
Weir Apologizes For "Minute Technical Adjustments," That Should 
Take "30 Seconds Or So." Healy Puts The Echo On "30 Seconds Or 
So," And It Repeats Many Times.
